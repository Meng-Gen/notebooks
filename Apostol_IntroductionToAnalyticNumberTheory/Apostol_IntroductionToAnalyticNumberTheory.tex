In these exercises lower case latin letters $a, b, c, \ldots, x, y, z$ represent integers.
Prove each of the statement in Exercise 1.1 through 1.6. \\



\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.1.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise 1.1.}
\emph{If $(a,b) = 1$ and if $c|a$ and $d|b$, then $(c,d) = 1$.} \\



\emph{Proof (Theorem 1.2).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $(a,b) = 1$ if and only if there are $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
  \[
    ax + by = 1
  \]
  (Theorem 1.2).
  As $c|a$ and $d|b$, there exist $c', d' \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
  $cc' = a$ and $dd' = b$.

\item[(2)]
  Hence
  \[
    c\underbrace{(c'x)}_{:= x'} + d\underbrace{(d'y)}_{:= y'} = 1
  \]
  for some $x', y' \in \mathbb{Z}$.
  That is, $(c,d) = 1$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof (Theorem 1.12).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \[
    a = \prod p_i^{a_i}, \qquad
    b = \prod p_i^{b_i}.
  \]
  Here $\min\{a_i, b_i\} = 0$ since $(a,b) = 1$ (Theorem 1.12).

\item[(2)]
  As $c|a$ and $d|b$,
  \[
    c = \prod p_i^{a_i'}, \qquad
    d = \prod p_i^{b_i'}
  \]
  where $a_i' \leq a_i$ and $b_i' \leq b_i$.
  As $0 \leq \min\{a_i', b_i'\} \leq \min\{a_i, b_i\} = 0$, $\min\{a_i', b_i'\} = 0$.
  Hence $(c,d) = \prod p_i^{\min\{a_i', b_i'\}} = 1$ (Theorem 1.12).
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.2.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise 1.2.}
\emph{If $(a,b) = (a,c) = 1$, then $(a,bc) = 1$.} \\



\emph{Proof (Theorem 1.2).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $(a,b) = (a,c) = 1$ implies that there are $x, y, z, w \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
  \[
    ax + by = 1, \qquad
    az + cw = 1
  \]
  (Theorem 1.2).

\item[(2)]
  So
  \[
    1
    = (ax + by)(az + cw)
    = a\underbrace{(axz + byz + cxw)}_{:= x'} + bc\underbrace{(yw)}_{:= y'}
  \]
  for some $x', y' \in \mathbb{Z}$.
  That is, $(a,bc) = 1$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof (Theorem 1.12).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \[
    a = \prod p_i^{a_i}, \qquad
    b = \prod p_i^{b_i}, \qquad
    c = \prod p_i^{c_i}.
  \]
  Here $\min\{a_i, b_i\} = \min\{a_i, c_i\} = 0$ since $(a,b) = (a,c) = 1$ (Theorem 1.12).
  Observe that $bc = \prod p_i^{b_i+c_i}$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that for all $i$,
  $\min\{a_i, b_i+c_i\} = 0$ if $\min\{a_i, b_i\} = \min\{a_i, c_i\} = 0$.}
  Nothing to do if $a_i = 0$.
  So if $a_i > 0$, we have
  \[
    b_i = c_i = 0
    \Longrightarrow b_i+c_i = 0
    \Longrightarrow \min\{a_i, b_i+c_i\} = 0.
  \]

\item[(3)]
  Therefore, $(a,bc) = \prod p_i^{\min\{a_i, b_i+c_i\}} = 1$ (Theorem 1.12).
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.3.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise 1.3.}
\emph{If $(a,b) = 1$, then $(a^n,b^k) = 1$ for all $n \geq 1$, $k \geq 1$.} \\



\emph{Proof (Theorem 1.2).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $(a,b) = 1$ implies that there are $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
  \[
    ax + by = 1
  \]
  (Theorem 1.2).

\item[(2)]
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    1
    =& \: (ax + by)^{n+k-1} \\
    =& \: \sum_{i=0}^{n+k-1} {n+k-1 \choose i} (ax)^i (by)^{n+k-1-i} \\
    =& \: \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} {n+k-1 \choose i} (ax)^i (by)^{n+k-1-i} \\
        & \: + \sum_{i=n}^{n+k-1} {n+k-1 \choose i} (ax)^i (by)^{n+k-1-i} \\
    =& \: b^k \underbrace{y^k \sum_{i=0}^{n} {n+k-1 \choose i} (ax)^i (by)^{n-1-i}}_{:= y'} \\
        & \: + a^n \underbrace{x^n \sum_{i=n}^{n+k-1} {n+k-1 \choose i} (ax)^{i-n} (by)^{n+k-1-i}}_{:= x'}
  \end{align*}
  for some $x', y' \in \mathbb{Z}$.
  That is, $(a^n,b^k) = 1$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof (Theorem 1.12).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \[
    a = \prod p_i^{a_i}, \qquad
    b = \prod p_i^{b_i}.
  \]
  Here $\min\{a_i, b_i\} = 0$ since $(a,b) = 1$ (Theorem 1.12).

\item[(2)]
  Observe that
  \[
    a^n = \prod p_i^{na_i}, \qquad
    b^k = \prod p_i^{kb_i}.
  \]
  Here $\min\{n a_i, k b_i\} = 0$
  (since $a_i = 0 \Longrightarrow na_i = 0$ and $b_i = 0 \Longrightarrow kb_i = 0$).
  Therefore $(a^n,b^k) = 1$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.11.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise 1.11.}
\emph{Prove that $n^4 + 4$ is composite if $n > 1$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
  \[
    n^4 + 4
    = (\underbrace{(n-1)^2 + 1}_{> 1})(\underbrace{(n+1)^2 + 1}_{> 1})
  \]
  since $n > 1$.
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.15.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise 1.15.}
\emph{Prove that every $n \geq 12$ is the sum of two composite numbers.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
  Write $n = 2m$ (resp. $n = 2m + 1$) where $m \in \mathbb{Z}$, $m \geq 6$.
  Then $n = 8 + 2(m-4)$ (resp. $n = 9 + 2(m-4)$) is the sum of two composite numbers.
$\Box$ \\\\



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.16. (Mersenne primes)}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise 1.16. (Mersenne primes)}
\emph{Prove that if $2^n-1$ is prime, then $n$ is prime.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
  Suppose $n$ is a composite number,
  then we can write $n = ab$ with $a > 1$, $b > 1$.
  Hence
  \[
    2^n - 1
    = 2^{ab} - 1
    = {2^a}^b - 1
    = \underbrace{(2^a - 1)}_{> 1}\underbrace{\{(2^a)^{b-1} + \cdots + 1\}}_{> 1}
  \]
  is also a composite number.
$\Box$ \\\\



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.17. (Fermat primes)}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise 1.17. (Fermat primes)}
\emph{Prove that if $2^n+1$ is prime, then $n$ is a power of $2$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
  Write $n = 2^a b$ where $a$ is a nonnegative integer and $b$ is odd.
  Suppose $n$ is not a power of $2$, then $b > 1$.
  Hence
  \[
    2^n + 1
    = 2^{2^a b} + 1
    = \underbrace{(2^{2^a} + 1)}_{> 1}
        \underbrace{\{2^{2^a(b-1)} - \cdots + 1\}}_{> 1}
  \]
  is a composite number.
  (Note that $1 < 2^{2^a(b-1)} < 2^n + 1$
  implies that $1 < (2^{2^a(b-1)} - \cdots + 1) < 2^n+1$ too.)
$\Box$ \\\\



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.30.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise 1.30.}
\emph{If $n > 1$ prove that the sum
\[
  \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k}
\]
is not an integer.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  Suppose
  \[
    H := \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k}
  \]
  were an integer.

\item[(2)]
  Let $s$ be the largest integer such that $2^s \leq n$.
  So the integer number
  \begin{align*}
    2^{s-1} H
    &= \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{2^{s-1}}{k} \\
    &= 2^{s-1} + 2^{s-2} + \frac{2^{s-1}}{3} + 2^{s-3} + \frac{2^{s-1}}{5} + \frac{2^{s-2}}{3}
      + \cdots + \frac{1}{2} + \cdots.
  \end{align*}
  has only one term of even denominators (as $n > 1$)
  if we write all terms in irreducible fractions.
  That is,
  \[
  	2^{s-1} H = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{c}{d} \in \mathbb{Z}
  \]
  where $\frac{c}{d}$ is an irreducible fraction with odd $d$.
  Hence it suffices to show that $2 \mid d$ to get a contradiction.

\item[(3)]
  By
  \[
  	\frac{1}{2} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{d + 2c}{2d} \in \mathbb{Z}
  \]
  we have $d + 2c = 2dd'$ for some $d' \in \mathbb{Z}$.
  Note that $2$ is a prime.
  So $2 \mid (d + 2c)$ or $2 \mid d$, which is absurd.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.1.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise 2.1.}
\emph{Find all integers $n$ such that}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{$\varphi(n) = \frac{n}{2}$,}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{$\varphi(n) = \varphi(2n)$,}

\item[(c)]
  \emph{$\varphi(n) = 12$.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
  \[
    \varphi(n) = n \prod_{p|n}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right) = \frac{n}{2}
  \]
  (Theorem 2.4) implies that $n = 2$.
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $\varphi(n) = \varphi(2n)$ implies that
  \[
    n \prod_{p|n}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right)
    = 2n \prod_{p|(2n)}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right).
  \]

\item[(2)]
  If $2 | n$, then $n = 2n$ or $n = 0$, which is absurd.

\item[(3)]
  If $2 \nmid n$, then
  \[
    n \prod_{p|n}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right)
    = 2n \prod_{p|(2n)}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right)
    = \underbrace{2n \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right)}_{= n}
      \prod_{p|n}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right)
  \]
  is always true.
  Hence $n$ is odd if $\varphi(n) = \varphi(2n)$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (c).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that the solutions of $\varphi(n) = 12$
  are $n = 13, 26, 21, 28, 42, 36$.}
  Write $n = p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots p_r^{\alpha_r}$
  where $p_1 < p_2 < \ldots$.
  Then
  \[
    12 = \varphi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^{r} p_i^{\alpha_i - 1}(p_i - 1).
  \]
  (Theorem 2.5).
  It implies that $p_i \in \{ 2, 3, 5, 7, 13 \}$ if $\alpha_i > 0$.
  Consider all possible cases of the greatest prime divisor $p_r$ of $n$ as follows.

\item[(2)]
  If $p_r = 13$, then $\alpha_r = 1$ since $13 \nmid 12$.
  So
  \[
    12
    = \varphi(n)
    = \underbrace{\varphi(13)}_{= 12} \varphi\left(\frac{n}{13}\right)
  \]
  or $1 = \varphi\left(\frac{n}{13}\right)$.
  Hence $\frac{n}{13} = 1, 2$.
  In this case $n = 13, 26$.

\item[(3)]
  If $p_r = 7$, then $\alpha_r = 1$ since $7 \nmid 12$.
  So
  \[
    12
    = \varphi(n)
    = \underbrace{\varphi(7)}_{= 6} \varphi\left(\frac{n}{7}\right)
  \]
  or $2 = \varphi\left(\frac{n}{7}\right)$.
  Hence $\frac{n}{7} = 3, 4, 6$.
  In this case $n = 21, 28, 42$.

\item[(5)]
  If $p_r = 5$, then $\alpha_r = 1$ since $5 \nmid 12$.
  So $12 = \varphi(5)\varphi\left(\frac{n}{5}\right)$
  or $3 = \varphi\left(\frac{n}{5}\right)$, which is impossible.

\item[(6)]
  If $p_r = 3$, then $\alpha_r = 1, 2$.
  $\alpha_r = 1$ is impossible since $3 | 12$.
  So
  \[
    12
    = \varphi(n)
    = \underbrace{\varphi(3^2)}_{= 6}\varphi\left(\frac{n}{3^2}\right)
  \]
  or $2 = \varphi\left(\frac{n}{3^2}\right)$.
  Hence $\frac{n}{3^2} = 4$.
  (By assumption $\frac{n}{3^2}$ cannot have any prime factor $> 3$.)
  In this case $n = 36$.

$\Box$ \\\\

\emph{Proof of (a).}
  It is false since $(5, 13) = 1$ and $(\varphi(5),\varphi(13)) = (4, 12) = 4$.
$\Box$ \\


\emph{Proof of (b).}
  It is false since $(15, \varphi(15)) = (15, 8) = 1$.

\begin{enumerate}

  It is true.

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Note that $fg$, $f/g$ and $f * g$ are multiplicative if $f$ and $g$ are multiplicative
  (Example 5 on page 34 and Theorem 2.14).
  Hence $\frac{n}{\varphi(n)}$ and $\sum_{d|n} \frac{\mu^2(d)}{\varphi(d)}$
  are multiplicative.
  Hence it might assume that $n = p^a$ for some prime $p$ and integer $a \geq 1$.
  (The case $n=1$ is trivial.)

\item[(2)]
  \[
    \frac{p^a}{\varphi(p^a)}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Supplement 2.3.1. (Chinese remainder theorem)}
(Exercise I.3.5 in the textbook: \emph{J\"orgen Neukirch, Algebraic Number Theory}.)
\emph{The quotient ring $\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{a}$ of a Dedekind domain by
an ideal $\mathfrak{a} \neq 0$ is a principal ideal domain.
(Hint: For $\mathfrak{a} = \mathfrak{p}^n$ the only proper ideals of $\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{a}$
are given by $\mathfrak{p}/\mathfrak{p}^n, \ldots, \mathfrak{p}^{n-1}/\mathfrak{p}^n$.
Choose $\pi \in \mathfrak{p} \smallsetminus \mathfrak{p}^2$
and show that $\mathfrak{p}^{\nu} = \mathcal{O}\pi^{\nu} + \mathfrak{p}^n$.)} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  By the Chinese remainder theorem,
  it suffices to show the case $\mathfrak{a} = \mathfrak{p}^n$ where $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime.

\item[(2)]
  There is a natural correspondence between
  \[
    \{ \text{ideals of $\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{p}^n$} \}
    \longleftrightarrow
    \{ \text{ideals of $\mathcal{O}$ containing $\mathfrak{p}^n$} \}.
  \]
  Hence the proper ideals of $\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{p}^n$
  are given by $\mathfrak{p}/\mathfrak{p}^n, \ldots, \mathfrak{p}^{n-1}/\mathfrak{p}^n$.

\item[(3)]
  Similar to Exercise I.3.4,
  choose $\pi \in \mathfrak{p} \smallsetminus \mathfrak{p}^2$
  and thus $\mathfrak{p}^{\nu} = \mathcal{O}\pi^{\nu} + \mathfrak{p}^n$
  ($\nu = 1, \ldots, n-1$)
  since they have the same prime factorization.
  Hence
  $\mathfrak{p}^{\nu}/\mathfrak{p}^n = (\pi^{\nu} + \mathfrak{p}^n)$ is principal.

\emph{Proof.}
  It is easy to verify that

    f(n) :=

  Write $n = p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots p_r^{\alpha_r} q_1^{\beta_1} \cdots q_s^{\beta_s}$

  The proof is similar to Theorem 2.1.

\emph{Let $\mu(p,d)$ denote the value of the M\"obius function at the gcd of $p$ and $d$.
Prove that for every prime $p$ we have
\begin{equation*}
  \sum_{d|n} \mu(d) \mu(p,d) =
  \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if $n = 1$}, \\
    2 & \text{if $n = p^a$, $a \geq 1$}, \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  It suffices to show that $\mu(p,n)$ is multiplicative.
  If so, then
  \[
    h(n) := \sum_{d|n} \mu(d)\mu(p,d)
  \]
  is also multiplicative
  by taking $f(n) := \mu(n)\mu(p,n)$ and $g(n) := 1$ in Theorem 2.14.

\item[(2)]
  A direct calculation shows that $h(1) = 1$ (or by Theorem 2.12) and
  \begin{align*}
    h(p^a) &= \mu(1)\mu(p,1) + \mu(p)\mu(p,p) = 1 \cdot 1 + (-1) \cdot (-1) = 2, \\
    h(q^b) &= \mu(1)\mu(p,1) + \mu(q)\mu(p,q) = 1 \cdot 1 + (-1) \cdot 1 = 0
  \end{align*}
  where $q \neq p$ and $a, b \geq 1$.
  Hence (1) and Theorem 2.13 show that
  \begin{equation*}
    h(n) =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if $n = 1$}, \\
      2 & \text{if $n = p^a$, $a \geq 1$}, \\
      0 & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $\mu(p,n)$ is multiplicative.}
  Suppose $(m,n) = 1$.
  There are two possible cases: $p \nmid mn$ and $p|mn$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    If $p \neq mn$, then all $\mu(p,mn), \mu(p,m), \mu(p,n)$ are equal to $\mu(1) = 1$.

  \item[(b)]
    If $p | mn$, then $p|m$ or $p|n$.
    Note that $(m,n) = 1$ and thus $p$ cannot be a common divisor of $m, n$.
    Hence $\mu(p,mn) = \mu(p) = -1$ and $\mu(p,m)\mu(p,n) = \mu(p)\mu(1) = -1$.
  \end{enumerate}
  In any case $\mu(p,mn) = \mu(p,m)\mu(p,n)$ if $(m,n) = 1$.

[Hint: Induction.]} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Induction.

\item[(2)]
  (Base case)
  Suppose $m = 1$.
  Theorem 2.11 implies that
  \[
    \sum_{d|n} \mu(d) \log(d) = - \Lambda(n) = 0
  \]
  since $n$ has at least $2$ distinct prime factors.

\item[(3)]
  (Inductive step)
  Suppose the conclusion holds for $m < m_0$ and $n$ has more than $m$ distinct prime factors.
  Given $n$ having more than $m_0$ distinct prime factors.
  Write $n = p^a n'$ where $a > 0$ and $p \nmid n'$.
  (Here $q$ has more than $m_0 - 1$ distinct prime factors.)
  So by the induction hypothesis and $\sum_{d|n'} \mu(d) = 0$,
  we have
  \begin{align*}
    &\:
    \sum_{d|n} \mu(d) (\log d)^{m_0} \\
    =&\: \sum_{d|n'} \sum_{i = 0}^{a} \mu(p^i d) (\log p^i d)^{m_0} \\

        - m_0 \log p \sum_{d|n'} \mu(d) (\log d)^{m_0 - 1} \\
    =&\: 0.

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.9.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise 2.9.}
\emph{If $x$ is real, $x \geq 1$, let $\varphi(x,n)$ denote
the number of positive integers $\leq x$ that are relatively prime to $n$.
[Note that $\varphi(n,n) = \varphi(n)$.]
Prove that
\[
  \varphi(x,n) = \sum_{d|n} \mu(d) \left[ \frac{x}{d} \right],
  \qquad
  \sum_{d|n} \varphi\left( \frac{x}{d},\frac{n}{d} \right) = [x].
\]}



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\varphi(x,n) = \sum_{d|n} \mu(d) \left[ \frac{x}{d} \right]$.}
  Similar to the proof of Theorem 2.3.
  $\varphi(x,n)$ can be written in the form
  \[
    \varphi(x,n) = \sum_{1 \leq k \leq x}\left[ \frac{1}{(n,k)} \right],
  \]
  where now $k$ runs through all integers $\leq x$.
  Now we use Theorem 2.1 with $n$ replaced by $(n,k)$ to obtain
  \[
    \varphi(x,n)
    = \sum_{1 \leq k \leq x} \sum_{d|(n,k)} \mu(d)
    = \sum_{1 \leq k \leq x} \sum_{\substack{d|n \\ d|k}} \mu(d).
  \]
  For a fixed divisor $d$ of $n$ we must sum over all those $k$ in the range $1 \leq k \leq x$
  which are multiples of $d$.
  If we write $k = qd$ then $1 \leq k \leq x$ if and only if
  $1 \leq q \leq \left[ \frac{x}{d} \right]$.
  Hence the last sum for $\varphi(x,n)$ can be written as
  \[
    \varphi(x,n)
    = \sum_{d|n} \sum_{1 \leq q \leq \left[ \frac{x}{d} \right]} \mu(d)
    = \sum_{d|n} \mu(d) \sum_{1 \leq q \leq \left[ \frac{x}{d} \right]} 1
    = \sum_{d|n} \mu(d) \left[ \frac{x}{d} \right].
  \]

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $\sum_{d|n} \varphi\left( \frac{x}{d},\frac{n}{d} \right) = [x]$.}
  Similar to the proof of Theorem 2.2.
  Let $S$ denote the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots, [x] \}$.
  We distribute the integers of $S$ into disjoint sets as follows.
  For each divisor $d$ of $n$, let
  \[
    A(d) = \{ k : (k,n) = d, 1 \leq k \leq x \}.
  \]
  That is, $A(d)$ contains those elements of $S$ which have the gcd $d$ with $n$.
  The sets $A(d)$ form a disjoint collection whose union is $S$.
  Therefore if $f(d)$ denotes the number of integers in $A(d)$ we have
  \[
    \sum_{d|n} f(d) = [x].
  \]
  But $(k,n) = d$ if and only if $\left( \frac{k}{d}, \frac{n}{d} \right) = 1$,
  and $0 < k \leq x$ if and only if $0 < \frac{k}{d} \leq \frac{x}{d}$.
  Therefore, if we let $q = \frac{k}{d}$,
  there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements in $A(d)$
  and those integers $q$ satisfying
  $0 < q \leq \frac{x}{d}$, $\left( q, \frac{n}{d} \right) = 1$.
  The number of such $q$ is $\varphi\left( \frac{x}{d},\frac{n}{d} \right)$.
  Hence $f(d) = \varphi\left( \frac{x}{d},\frac{n}{d} \right)$ and thus
  \[
    \sum_{d|n} \varphi\left( \frac{x}{d},\frac{n}{d} \right) = [x].

    = (\alpha_1 + 1) \cdots (\alpha_r + 1)

  Exercise 2.10 shows that $d(n)$ is multiplicative.

  both $f(n) := \sum_{t|n} d(t)^3$ and $g(n) := \left(\sum_{t|n} d(t)\right)^2$

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Similar to the proof of Theorem 3.2.
  We take $f(t) = \frac{\log t}{t}$ in Euler's summation formula to obtain
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{n \leq x} \frac{\log n}{n}

\item[(2)]
  The improper integral $\int_{1}^{\infty}(t-[t])\frac{1-\log t}{t^2} dt$
  exists since it is dominated by
  $\int_{1}^{e} \frac{1-\log t}{t^2} dt + \int_{e}^{\infty} \frac{\log t - 1}{t^2} dt = 2e^{-1}$.

        + O\left( \frac{1}{x \log x} \right).
  \end{align*}

\item[(2)]
  The improper integral $\int_{2}^{\infty} (t-[t])\frac{\log t + 1}{t^2 (\log t)^2} dt$
  exists since it is dominated by
  $\int_{2}^{\infty} \frac{\log t + 1}{t^2 (\log t)^2} dt = \frac{1}{2\log 2} < \infty$.

\emph{Proof.}
  Similar to the proof of Theorem 3.3, we have

  Now we use Theorem 3.2(a) to obtain

    = \sum_{\substack{q,d \\ qd \leq x}} \frac{1}{q^{\alpha}d^{\alpha}}
    = \sum_{d \leq x} \frac{1}{d^{\alpha}} \sum_{q \leq \frac{x}{d}} \frac{1}{q^{\alpha}}.
  \]
  Now we use Theorem 3.2(b) to obtain
  \[
    \sum_{q \leq \frac{x}{d}} \frac{1}{q^{\alpha}}
    = \frac{1}{d^{1-\alpha}} \cdot \frac{x^{1-\alpha}}{1-\alpha} + \zeta(\alpha)
        + O\left(\frac{d^{\alpha}}{x^{\alpha}}\right).
  \]
  Using this along with Theorem 3.2 we find
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{n \leq x} \frac{d(n)}{n^{\alpha}}
    =& \: \sum_{d \leq x}
        \frac{1}{d^{\alpha}} \left\{ \frac{1}{d^{1-\alpha}} \cdot \frac{x^{1-\alpha}}{1-\alpha}
            + \zeta(\alpha)
            + O\left(\frac{d^{\alpha}}{x^{\alpha}}\right) \right\} \\
    =& \: \frac{x^{1-\alpha}}{1-\alpha} \sum_{d \leq x} \frac{1}{d}
        + \zeta(\alpha) \sum_{d \leq x} \frac{1}{d^{\alpha}}
        + \sum_{d \leq x} O(x^{-\alpha}) \\
    =& \: \frac{x^{1-\alpha}}{1-\alpha} \left\{ \log x + C + O(x^{-1}) \right\} \\
      & + \zeta(\alpha)
          \left\{ \frac{x^{1-\alpha}}{1-\alpha} + \zeta(\alpha) + O(x^{-\alpha}) \right\}
          + O(x^{1-\alpha}) \\
    =& \: \frac{x^{1-\alpha} \log x}{1 - \alpha} + \zeta(\alpha)^2 + O(x^{1-\alpha}).

$\Box$ \\\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  (Proposition 2.5)
  The irreducible characters of a finite abelian $G$ are denoted
  $\chi_1, \ldots, \chi_h$;
  their degrees are written $n_1, \ldots, n_h$, we have $n_i = \chi_i(1)$.
  \emph{The degrees $n_i$ satisfy the relation $\sum_{i=1}^{i=h} n_i^2 = g$.}

\item[(2)]
  (Exercise 2.3.1)
  \emph{Show directly, using Schur's lemma,
  that each irreducible representation of an abelian group,
  finite of not, has degree $1$.}
  \emph{Proof.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    (Schur's lemma)
    Let $\rho^1: G \to \mathsf{GL}(V_1)$ and $\rho^2: G \to \mathsf{GL}(V_2)$ be
    two irreducible representations of $G$,
    and let $f$ be a linear mapping of $V_1$ into $V_2$ such that
    $\rho^2_s \circ f = f \circ \rho^1_s$ for all $s \in G$. Then:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)]
      If $\rho^1$ and $\rho^2$ are not isomorphic, we have $f = 0$.

    \item[(ii)]
      If $V_1 = V_2$ and $\rho^1 = \rho^2$, $f$ is a homothety (i.e., a scalar multiple of the identity).
    \end{enumerate}

  \item[(b)]
    Let $\rho: G \to \mathsf{GL}(V)$ be an irreducible representations of $G$.
    Since $G$ is abelian,
    \[
      \rho_s \circ \rho_t = \rho_t \circ \rho_s.
    \]
    Schur's lemma implies that $\rho_s$ is a homothety for any $s \in G$.
    Since $\rho$ is irreducible, $\dim V$ cannot be strictly larger than $1$.
  \end{enumerate}
  $\Box$

\item[(3)]
  (Proposition 2.7)
  \emph{The number of irreducible representations of $G$ (up to isomorphism)
  is equal to the number of classes of $G$.}

\emph{Let $G$ be a set of $n$th roots of a nonzero complex number.
If $G$ is a group under multiplication,

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \[
    G = \left\{ z \in \mathbb{C} : z^n = w \right\}
  \]
  where $w \in \mathbb{C}^{\times}$.
  It suffices to show that $w = 1$.

\item[(2)]
  Since the multiplication is the binary operation on $G$,
  $z_1 \cdot z_2 \in G$ whenever $z_1, z_2 \in G$.
  Hence $w = (z_1 \cdot z_2)^n = (z_1)^n \cdot (z_2)^n = w \cdot w= w^2$ or $w = 1$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\subsubsection*{Supplement.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Supplement.}

Let $k > 0$ and $(h,k) = 1$.
Let $P$ be the set of primes numbers.
Let $P_h$ be the set of primes numbers such that $p \equiv h \pmod k$.
\\


\emph{Theorem 7.3.}
\[
  \sum_{\substack{p \leq x \\ p \in P_h}} \frac{\log p}{p} = \frac{1}{\varphi(k)} \log x + O(1)
\]
for all $x > 1$. \\

We deal with the series $\sum p^{-1} \log p$ rather than $\sum p^{-1}$ to simplify the proof.
Compare to the book \emph{Serre, A Course in Arithmetic} for a classical proof of Dirichlet's Theorem:
\[
  \sum_{p \in P_h} \frac{1}{p^s} \sim \frac{1}{\varphi(k)} \log \frac{1}{s-1}.
\]
for $s \to 1$. \\



\emph{Outline of the proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Theorem 4.10 says that
  \[
    \sum_{p \leq x} \frac{\log p}{p}
    = \log x + O(1).
  \]
  Compare to Corollary 2 to Proposition VI.10 in \emph{Serre, A Course in Arithmetic}:
  When $s \to 1$, one has
  \[
    \sum_{p} p^{-s} \sim \log \frac{1}{s-1}.
  \]

\item[(2)]
  By the orthogonality relation for Dirichlet characters,
  \begin{align*}
    \varphi(k) \sum_{\substack{p \leq x \\ p \in P_h}} \frac{\log p}{p}
    &= \overline{\chi_1}(h) \sum_{p \leq x} \frac{\chi_1(p) \log p}{p} 
        + \sum_{r=2}^{\varphi(k)} \overline{\chi_r}(h)\sum_{p \leq x} \frac{\chi_r(p) \log p}{p} \\
    &= \sum_{\substack{p \leq x \\ p \in P_k}} \frac{\log p}{p}
        + \sum_{r=2}^{\varphi(k)} \overline{\chi_r}(h)\sum_{p \leq x} \frac{\chi_r(p) \log p}{p}.
  \end{align*}
  Hence it suffices to consider $\sum_{\substack{p \leq x \\ p \in P_k}} \frac{\log p}{p}$
  and $\sum_{p \leq x} \frac{\chi_r(p) \log p}{p}$.
  Compare to Lemma VI.9 in \emph{Serre, A Course in Arithmetic}:
  Let
  \[
    f_{\chi}(s) = \sum_{p \nmid k} \frac{\chi(p)}{p^s}.
  \]
  Then
  \[
    \sum_{p \in P_h} \frac{1}{p^s}
    = \frac{1}{\varphi(k)} \sum_{\chi} \chi(h)^{-1} f_{\chi}(s).
  \]
  Again it suffices to consider two cases $\chi = 1$ and $\chi \neq 1$.

\item[(3)]
  Show that
  \[
    \sum_{\substack{p \leq x \\ p \in P_k}} \frac{\log p}{p}
    = \sum_{p \leq x} \frac{\log p}{p} + O(1).
  \]
  Compare to Lemma VI.7 in \emph{Serre, A Course in Arithmetic}:
  If $\chi = 1$, then for $s \to 1$
  \[
    f_{\chi}(s) \sim \log \frac{1}{s - 1}.
  \]

\item[(4)]
  Show that
  \[
    \sum_{p \leq x} \frac{\chi(p) \log p}{p} = O(1)
  \]
  for each $\chi \neq \chi_1$.
  Compare to Lemma VI.8 in \emph{Serre, A Course in Arithmetic}:
  If $\chi \neq 1$, $f_{\chi}(s)$ remains bounded when $s \to 1$.

\item[(5)]
  To prove part (4), consider the sum
  \[
    \sum_{n \leq x} \frac{\chi(n) \Lambda(n)}{n}
  \]
  and we write the sum as
  \[
    \sum_{n \leq x} \frac{\chi(n) \Lambda(n)}{n}
    = \sum_{p \leq x} \frac{\chi(p) \log p}{p}
        + \underbrace{\sum_{p \leq x} \sum_{1 \leq a \leq \frac{\log x}{\log p}}
            \frac{\chi(p^a) \log p}{p^a}}_{= O(1)}.
  \]
  Hence it suffices to show that $\sum_{n \leq x} \frac{\chi(n) \Lambda(n)}{n} = O(1)$.
  The proof is elementary and worth reading too.
  Compare to the proof of Lemma VI.8 in \emph{Serre, A Course in Arithmetic}:
  we consider the $L$ function
  \[
    L(s,\chi)
    = \sum \frac{\chi(n)}{n^s}
    = \prod \frac{1}{1 - \frac{\chi(p)}{p^s}}
  \]
  for $\mathrm{Re}(s) > 1$.
  Write
  \[
    \underbrace{\log L(s,\chi)}_{= O(1)}
    = f_{\chi}(s) + \underbrace{\sum_{\substack{p \\ m \geq 2}} \frac{\chi(p)^m}{mp^{ms}}}_{= O(1)}
  \]
  to get $f_{\chi}(s) = O(1)$.
  To prove $\log L(s,\chi) = O(1)$, we need some knowledge about complex analysis.
