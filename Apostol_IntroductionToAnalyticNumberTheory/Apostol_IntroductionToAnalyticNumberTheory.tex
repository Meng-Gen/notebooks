\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise 1.15.}
\emph{Prove that every $n \geq 12$ is the sum of two composite numbers.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
  Write $n = 2m$ (resp. $n = 2m + 1$) where $m \in \mathbb{Z}$, $m \geq 6$.
  Then $n = 8 + 2(m-4)$ (resp. $n = 9 + 2(m-4)$) is the sum of two composite numbers.

\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.30.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise 1.30.}
\emph{If $n > 1$ prove that the sum
\[
  \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k}
\]
is not an integer.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  Suppose
  \[
    H := \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k}
  \]
  were an integer.

\item[(2)]
  Let $s$ be the largest integer such that $2^s \leq n$.
  So the integer number
  \begin{align*}
    2^{s-1} H
    &= \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{2^{s-1}}{k} \\
    &= 2^{s-1} + 2^{s-2} + \frac{2^{s-1}}{3} + 2^{s-3} + \frac{2^{s-1}}{5} + \frac{2^{s-2}}{3}
      + \cdots + \frac{1}{2} + \cdots.
  \end{align*}
  has only one term of even denominators (as $n > 1$)
  if we write all terms in irreducible fractions.
  That is,
  \[
  	2^{s-1} H = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{c}{d} \in \mathbb{Z}
  \]
  where $\frac{c}{d}$ is an irreducible fraction with odd $d$.
  Hence it suffices to show that $2 \mid d$ to get a contradiction.

\item[(3)]
  By
  \[
  	\frac{1}{2} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{d + 2c}{2d} \in \mathbb{Z}
  \]
  we have $d + 2c = 2dd'$ for some $d' \in \mathbb{Z}$.
  Note that $2$ is a prime.
  So $2 \mid (d + 2c)$ or $2 \mid d$, which is absurd.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.4.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise 2.4.}
\emph{Prove that $\varphi(n) > \frac{n}{6}$ for all $n$ with at most $8$ distinct prime factors.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \begin{align*}
    \varphi(n)
    = &\:
    n \prod_{p|n}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right)
      &(\text{Theorem 2.4}) \\
    \geq &\:
    n \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{3} \right)
      \left( 1 - \frac{1}{5} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{7} \right) \\
    & \: \qquad
      \left( 1 - \frac{1}{11} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{13} \right)
      \left( 1 - \frac{1}{17} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{19} \right) \\
    = &\: \frac{55296}{323323} n \\
    > &\: \frac{n}{6}.
  \end{align*}

\item[(2)]
  The conclusion does not hold if $n$ has more than $9$ distinct prime factors.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\
