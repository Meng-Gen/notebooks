\textbf{Notes.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  (Equation (7))
  \[
    |D\Phi(x)| \leq \frac{C}{|x|^{n-1}}, \qquad
    |D^2\Phi(x)| \leq \frac{C}{|x|^{n}} \qquad (x \neq 0)
  \]
  for some constant $C > 0$.
  In fact,
  \begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\Phi(x)
  &= -\frac{1}{n\alpha(n)} x_i |x|^{-n}, \\
  \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}\Phi(x)
  &= \frac{1}{n\alpha(n)} (n x_i x_j - |x|^2 \delta_{ij}) |x|^{-n-2}. \\\\
  \end{align*}

\end{enumerate}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\textbf{Problem 2.1.}
\emph{Write down an explicit formula for a function $u$ solving
the initial-value problem
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
    u_t + b \cdot Du + cu = 0 & \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^n \times (0,\infty) \\
    u                     = g & \text{ on } \mathbb{R}^n \times \{ t=0 \}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
Here $c \in \mathbb{R}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are constants.} \\

\emph{Proof (Transport equation).}
Define
\[
  z(s) = u(x+sb,t+s) \qquad (s \in \mathbb{R}).
\]
So
\begin{align*}
  \dot{z}(s)
  &= Du(x+sb,t+s) \cdot b + u_t(x+sb,t+s) \\
  &= -cu(x+sb,t+s) \\
  &= -cz(s).
\end{align*}
Solve this ODE to get
\begin{align*}
  z(s) = z(0) e^{-cs}
  &\Longrightarrow
  u(x+sb,t+s) = u(x,t) e^{-cs} \\
  &\Longrightarrow
  u(x-tb,0) = u(x,t) e^{ct}
    &\text{(Let $s = -t$)} \\
  &\Longrightarrow
  g(x-tb) = u(x,t) e^{ct} \\
  &\Longrightarrow
  u(x,t) = g(x-tb) e^{-ct}.
\end{align*}
$\Box$ \\\\

\textbf{Problem 2.2.}
\emph{Prove that Laplace's equation $\Delta u = 0$ is rotation invariant;
that is, if $O$ is an orthogonal $n \times n$ matrix and we define
\[
  v(x) := u(Ox) \qquad (x \in \mathbb{R}^n),
\]
then $\Delta v = 0$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $O = [O_{ij}]$.
  $O$ is orthogonal if $OO^{t} = O^{t}O = I$,
  or
  \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} O_{pi} O_{qi} = \delta_{pq}
  \]
  where $\delta_{pq}$ is the Kronecker delta.

\item[(2)]
  Let $y = Ox$.
  So that
  \begin{align*}
    D_i v(x)
    &= \sum_{p=1}^{n} D_p u(y) O_{pi}, \\
    D_{ij} v(x)
    &= \sum_{q=1}^{n} \sum_{p=1}^{n} D_{pq}u(y) O_{pi} O_{qj}, \\
    \Delta v(x)
    &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} D_{ii} v(x) \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{q=1}^{n}\sum_{p=1}^{n} D_{pq}u(y) O_{pi} O_{qi} \\
    &= \sum_{q=1}^{n} \sum_{p=1}^{n} D_{pq} u(y) \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} O_{pi} O_{qi} \right) \\
    &= \sum_{q=1}^{n} \sum_{p=1}^{n} D_{pq} \delta_{pq} \\
    &= \sum_{q=1}^{n} D_{qq}u(y) \\
    &= \Delta u(y).
  \end{align*}

\item[(3)]
  As $\Delta u(y) = 0$, $\Delta v(x) = 0$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\textbf{Problem 2.3.}
\emph{Modify the proof of the mean value formulas to show for $n \geq 3$ that
\[
  u(0)
  =
    \mint{-}_{\partial B(0,r)} g dS
  +
    \frac{1}{n(n-2)\alpha(n)}
    \int_{B(0,r)}\left( \frac{1}{|x|^{n-2}} - \frac{1}{r^{n-2}} \right) f dx,
\]
provided}
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
    - \Delta u = f & \text{ in } B^{0}(0,r) \\
    u          = g & \text{ on } \partial B(0,r).
