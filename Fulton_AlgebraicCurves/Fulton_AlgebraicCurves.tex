\subsubsection*{Problem 1.1.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.1.*}
\emph{Let $R$ be a domain.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{If $f$, $g$ are forms of degree $r$, $s$ respectively in $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$,
  show that $fg$ is a form of degree $r+s$.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that any factor of a form in $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is also a form. } \\
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    f &= \sum_{(i)} a_{(i)} x^{(i)}, \\
    g &= \sum_{(j)} b_{(j)} x^{(j)},
  \end{align*}
  where $\sum_{(i)}$ is the summation over $(i) = (i_1,\ldots,i_n)$ with $i_1+\cdots+i_n = r$
  and $\sum_{(j)}$ is the summation over $(j) = (j_1,\ldots,j_n)$ with $j_1+\cdots+j_n = s$.

\item[(2)]
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    fg
    &= \sum_{(i)} \sum_{(j)} a_{(i)}b_{(j)} x^{(i)}x^{(j)} \\
    &= \sum_{(i),(j)} a_{(i)}b_{(j)} x^{(k)}
  \end{align*}
  where $(k) = (i_1+j_1,\ldots,i_n+j_n)$ with $(i_1+j_1)+\cdots+(i_n+j_n) = r+s$.
  Each $x^{(k)}$ is the form of degree $r+s$ and $a_{(i)}b_{(j)} \in R$.
  Hence $fg$ is a form of degree $r+s$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Given any form $f \in R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, and write $f = gh$.
  \emph{It suffices to show that $g$ is a form as well.}
  (So does $h$.)

\item[(2)]
  Write
  \[
    g = g_0+\cdots+g_r,
    \qquad
    h = h_0+\cdots+h_s
  \]
  where $g_r \neq 0$ and $h_s \neq 0$.
  So
  \[
    f = gh = g_0h_0 + \cdots + g_r h_s.
  \]
  Since $R$ is a domain, $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is a domain and thus $g_r h_s \neq 0$.
  The maximality of $r$ and $s$ implies that $\deg f = r+s$.
  Therefore, by the maximality of $r+s$,
  $f = g_r h_s$, or $g = g_r$, or $g$ is a form.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.5.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.5.*}
\emph{Let $k$ be any field.
Show that there are an infinitely number of irreducible monic polynomials in $k[x]$.
(Hint: Suppose $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ were all of them, and factor $f_1\cdots f_n+1$ into irreducible factors.)} \\

\emph{Proof (Due to Euclid).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  If
  $f_1, \ldots, f_n$ were all irreducible monic polynomials, then
  we consider
  \[
    g = f_1 \cdots f_n + 1 \in k[x].
  \]
  So there is an irreducible monic polynomial $f = f_i$ dividing $g$ for some $i$
  since
  \[
    \deg g = \deg f_1 + \cdots + \deg f_n \geq 1.
  \]

\item[(2)]
  However, $f$ would divide the difference
  \[
    g - f_1 \cdots f_{i-1} f_i f_{i+1} \cdots f_n = 1,
  \]
  contrary to $\deg f_i \geq 1$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.6.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.6.*}
\emph{Show that any algebraically closed field is infinite.
(Hint: The irreducible monic polynomials are $x - a$, $a \in k$.)} \\

\emph{Proof (Due to Euclid).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field.
  If $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ were all elements in $k$, then
  we consider a monic polynomials
  \[
    f(x) = (x - a_1) \cdots (x - a_n) + 1 \in k[x].
  \]

\item[(2)]
  Since $k$ is algebraically closed,
  there is an element $a \in k$ such that $f(a) = 0$.
  By assumption, $a = a_i$ for some $1 \leq i \leq n$,
  and thus $f(a) = f(a_i) = 1$, contrary to the fact that
  a field is a commutative ring where $0 \neq 1$ and all nonzero elements are invertible.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.8.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.8.*}
\emph{Show that the algebraic subsets of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ are just the finite subsets, together
with $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ itself.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $k[x]$ is a PID if $k$ is a field.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    Let $I$ be an ideal of $k[x]$.

  \item[(b)]
    If $I = \{0\}$ then $I = (0)$ and $I$ is principal.

  \item[(c)]
    If $I \neq \{0\}$, then take $f$ to be a polynomial of minimal degree in $I$.
    It suffices to show that $I = (f)$.
    Clearly, $(f) \subseteq I$ since $I$ is an ideal.
    Conversely, for any $g \in I$,
    \[
      g(x) = f(x)h(x) + r(x)
    \]
    for some $h, r \in k[x]$ with $r = 0$ or $\deg r < \deg f$.
    Now as
    \[
      r = g - fh \in I,
    \]
    $r = 0$ (otherwise contrary to the minimality of $f$),
    we have $g = fh \in (f)$ for all $g \in I$.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(2)]
  Let $Y$ be an algebraic subset of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$,
  say $Y = V(I)$ for some ideal $I$ of $k[x]$.
  Since $k[x]$ is a PID, $I = (f)$ for some $f \in k[x]$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    If $f = 0$, then $I = (0)$ and $Y = V(0) = \mathbf{A}^1(k)$.

  \item[(b)]
    If $f \neq 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ has finitely many roots in $k$,
    say $a_1, \ldots, a_m \in k$.
    Hence,
    \[
      Y = V(I) = V(f) = \{ f(a) = 0 : a \in k \}
      = \{ a_1, \ldots, a_m \}
    \]
    is a finite subsets of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  By (a)(b), the result is established.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Notes.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  By the Hilbert basis theorem, $k[x]$ is Noetherian as $k$ is Noetherian.
  Hence, for any algebraic subset $Y = V(I)$ of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$,
  we can write $I = (f_1, \cdots, f_m)$.
  Note that
  \[
    Y = V(I) = V(f_1) \cap \cdots \cap V(f_m).
  \]
  Now apply the same argument to get the same conclusion.

\item[(2)]
  Suppose $k = \overline{k}$.
  $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ is irreducible, because its only proper closed subsets are finite,
  yet it is infinite
  (because $k$ is algebraically closed, hence infinite). \\
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.11.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.11.}
\emph{Show that the following are algebraic sets:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  $\{ (t,t^2,t^3) \in \mathbf{A}^{3}(k) : t \in k \}$;

\item[(b)]
  $\{ (\cos(t),\sin(t)) \in \mathbf{A}^{2}(\mathbb{R}) : t \in \mathbb{R} \}$;

\item[(c)]
  \emph{the set of points in $\mathbf{A}^{2}(\mathbb{R})$
  whose polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$ satisfy the equation $r = \sin(\theta)$.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  The twisted cubic curve
  \[
    Y = \{ (t,t^2,t^3) \in \mathbf{A}^3(k) : t \in k \}
    =
    V(x^2-y) \cap V(x^3-z)
  \]
  is algebraic.
  We say that $Y$ is given by the parametric representation $x=t$, $y=t^2$, $z=t^3$.

\item[(2)]
  The generators for the ideal $I(Y)$ are $x^2-y$ and $x^3-z$.

\item[(3)]
  $Y$ is an affine variety of dimension $1$.

\item[(4)]
  The affine coordinate ring $A(Y)$ is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over $k$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
The circle
\[
  \{(\cos(t),\sin(t)) \in \mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R}) : t \in \mathbb{R} \} = V(x^2-y^2-1)
\]
is algebraic.
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (c).}
The circle
\[
  \{ (r,\theta) : r = \sin(\theta) \} = V(x^2+y^2-y)
\]
is algebraic again.
$\Box$\\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.15.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.15.*}
\emph{Let $V \subseteq \mathbf{A}^n(k)$, $W \subseteq \mathbf{A}^m(k)$ be algebraic sets.
Show that
\[
  V \times W
  = \{(a_1,\ldots,a_n,b_1,\ldots,b_m) : (a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in V, (b_1,\ldots,b_m) \in W \}
\]
is an algebraic set in $\mathbf{A}^{n+m}(k)$.
It is called the \textbf{product} of $V$ and $W$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    V &= V(S_V) = \{ a \in \mathbf{A}^n(k) : f(a) = 0 \: \forall f \in S_V \} \\
    W &= V(S_W) = \{ b \in \mathbf{A}^m(k) : g(b) = 0 \: \forall g \in S_W \},
  \end{align*}
  where $S_V \subseteq k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ and $S_W \subseteq k[y_1,\ldots,y_m]$.
  It suffices to show that
  \[
    V \times W = V(S),
  \]
  where
  $S \subseteq k[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m]$ is the union of $S_V$ and $S_W$.

\item[(2)]
  Here we can regard $S_V$ as a subset of
  $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m]$
  since
  \[
    k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]
    \hookrightarrow (k[y_1,\ldots,y_m])[x_1,\ldots,x_n]
    = k[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m].
  \]
  (Similar treatment to $S_W$.)

\item[(3)]
  By construction, $V \times W \subseteq V(S)$.
  Conversely, given any $(a,b) \in V(S)$, we have $h(a,b) = 0$ for all $h \in S = S_V \cup S_W$ (by (2)).
  By construction, $f(a) = 0$ for all $f \in S_V$ since $f$ only involve $x_1,\ldots,x_n$.
  Hence, $a \in V$. Similarly, $b \in W$. Therefore, $(a,b) \in V \times W$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\
