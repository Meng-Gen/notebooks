\subsubsection*{Problem 1.1.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.1.*}
\emph{Let $R$ be a domain.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{If $f$, $g$ are forms of degree $r$, $s$ respectively in $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$,
  show that $fg$ is a form of degree $r+s$.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that any factor of a form in $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is also a form. } \\
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    f &= \sum_{(i)} a_{(i)} x^{(i)}, \\
    g &= \sum_{(j)} b_{(j)} x^{(j)},
  \end{align*}
  where $\sum_{(i)}$ is the summation over $(i) = (i_1,\ldots,i_n)$ with $i_1+\cdots+i_n = r$
  and $\sum_{(j)}$ is the summation over $(j) = (j_1,\ldots,j_n)$ with $j_1+\cdots+j_n = s$.

\item[(2)]
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    fg
    &= \sum_{(i)} \sum_{(j)} a_{(i)}b_{(j)} x^{(i)}x^{(j)} \\
    &= \sum_{(i),(j)} a_{(i)}b_{(j)} x^{(k)}
  \end{align*}
  where $(k) = (i_1+j_1,\ldots,i_n+j_n)$ with $(i_1+j_1)+\cdots+(i_n+j_n) = r+s$.
  Each $x^{(k)}$ is the form of degree $r+s$ and $a_{(i)}b_{(j)} \in R$.
  Hence $fg$ is a form of degree $r+s$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Given any form $f \in R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, and write $f = gh$.
  \emph{It suffices to show that $g$ is a form as well.}
  (So does $h$.)

\item[(2)]
  Write
  \[
    g = g_0+\cdots+g_r,
    \qquad
    h = h_0+\cdots+h_s
  \]
  where $g_r \neq 0$ and $h_s \neq 0$.
  So
  \[
    f = gh = g_0h_0 + \cdots + g_r h_s.
  \]
  Since $R$ is a domain, $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is a domain and thus $g_r h_s \neq 0$.
  The maximality of $r$ and $s$ implies that $\deg f = r+s$.
  Therefore, by the maximality of $r+s$,
  $f = g_r h_s$, or $g = g_r$, or $g$ is a form.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.2.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.2.*}
\emph{Let $R$ be a UFD,
$K$ the quotient field of $R$.
Show that every element $z$ of $K$ may be written $z = a/b$,
where $a, b \in R$ have no common factors;
this representative is unique up to units of $R$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that every element $z$ of $K$ may be written $z=a/b$,
  where $a$, $b\in R$ have no common factors.}
  Given any $z = a/b \in K$ where $a, b\in R$.
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    a &= p_1 \cdots p_n, \\
    b &= q_1 \cdots q_m
  \end{align*}
  where all $p_1, \ldots, p_n, q_1, \ldots, q_m$ are irreducible in $R$.
  (It is possible since $R$ is a UFD.)
  For each $i$, suppose $p_i \mid q_j$ for some $i, j$.
  Write $q_j = p_i u$ for some $u \in R$.
  By the irreducibility of $p_i$ and $q_j$, $u$ is a unit.
  So
  \[
    z
    = \frac{a}{b}
    = \frac{p_1 \cdots \widehat{p_i} \cdots p_n}{q_1 \cdots \widehat{q_j} \cdots q_m}
    = \frac{p_1 \cdots \widehat{p_i} \cdots p_n}{u q_1 \cdots \widehat{q_j} \cdots q_m}.
  \]
  Continue this method we can write $z = \frac{a'}{b'}$ where $a'$ and $b'$ have no common factors.

\item[(2)]
  Write $z = a/b = a'/b'$ where
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    $a, b, a', b' \in R$,

  \item[(b)]
    $a$ and $b$ have no common factors,

  \item[(c)]
    $a'$ and $b'$ have no common factors.
  \end{enumerate}
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    a &= p_1 \cdots p_n, \\
    b &= q_1 \cdots q_m, \\
    a' &= p'_1 \cdots p'_{n'}, \\
    b' &= q'_1 \cdots q'_{m'}
  \end{align*}
  where all $p_i, q_j, p'_{i'}, q'_{j'}$ are irreducible in $R$.
  As $z = a/b = a'/b'$, $ab' = a'b$ or
  \[
    p_1 \cdots p_n q'_1 \cdots q'_{m'}
    = p'_1 \cdots p'_{n'} q_1 \cdots q_m.
  \]

\item[(3)]
  For $i = 1$, $p_1 = u_1 p'_{i'}$ for some unit $u_1 \in R$
  since $a$ and $b$ have no common factors and all $p_1, q_j, p'_{i'}$ are irreducible.
  Hence
  \[
    u_1 \widehat{p_1} p_2 \cdots p_n q'_1 \cdots q'_{m'}
    = p'_1 \cdots \widehat{p'_{i'}} \cdots p'_{n'} q_1 \cdots q_m.
  \]
  Continue this method,
  we have $n \leq n'$ and all $p_1, \ldots, p_n$ are canceled.

\item[(4)]
  Conversely, we can apply the argument in (3) to $i' = 1, \ldots n'$ to conclude that $n' \leq n$.
  Therefore, $n = n'$ and
  \[
    \underbrace{u_1 \cdots u_n}_{\text{a unit in $R$}} q'_1 \cdots q'_{m'} = q_1 \cdots q_m.
  \]
  Hence, $b = ub'$ where $u = u_1 \cdots u_n$ is a unit in $R$.
  Similarly, $a = va'$ where $v$ is a unit in $R$.
  So the representative of $z \in K$ is unique up to units of $R$.

$\Box$\\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.3.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.3.*}
\emph{Let $R$ be a PID. Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a nonzero, proper, prime ideal in $R$.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathfrak{p}$ is generated by an irreducible element.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathfrak{p}$ is maximal.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $\mathfrak{p} = (a)$ be a nonzero, proper, prime ideal in $R$.
  It suffices to show that $a$ is irreducible.

\item[(2)]
  Suppose $a = bc$.
  By the primality of $\mathfrak{p}$, $b \in \mathfrak{p}$ or $c \in \mathfrak{p}$.
  Suppose $b \in \mathfrak{p} = (a)$. (The case $c \in \mathfrak{p}$ is similar.)
  Then there is a $d \in R$ such that $b = ad$.
  Hence, $a = bc = adc$ or $(1-dc)a = 0$.

\item[(3)]
  Since $R$ is a domain, $1 = dc$ or $a = 0$.
  $a = 0$ implies that $\mathfrak{p} = (0)$ is a zero ideal, contrary to the assumption.
  Therefore, $1 = dc$, or $c$ is a unit, or $a$ is irreducible.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Given any ideal $I = (b)$ of $R$ containing $\mathfrak{p} = (a)$.
  As the generator $a$ of $\mathfrak{p}$ is in $\mathfrak{p} \subseteq I$,
  there is some $c \in R$ such that $a = bc$.
  By the irreducibility of $a$ (in (a)), $b$ is a unit or $c$ is a unit.

\item[(2)]
  $b$ is a unit implies that $I = R$.
  $c$ is a unit implies that $I = \mathfrak{p}$.
  In any case, we conclude that $\mathfrak{p}$ is maximal.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.4.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.4.*}
\emph{Let $k$ be an infinite field,
$f \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.
Suppose $f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) = 0$ for all $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in k$.
Show that $f = 0$.
(Hint: Write
\[
  f = \sum f_i x_n^{i},
  \qquad
  f_i \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}].
\]
Use induction on $n$,
and the fact that $f(a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}, x_n)$
has only a finite number of roots if any $f_i(a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}) \neq 0$.)} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Induction on $n$.
  The case $n = 1$.
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  If there were a nonzero $f \in k[x_1]$ such that $f(a) = 0$ for all $a \in k$.
  Note that $f$ has at most $\deg f < \infty$ roots,
  contrary to the infinity of $k$.

\item[(2)]
  Assume that the conclusion holds for $n - 1$, then for any $f \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
  we can write
  \[
    f = \sum f_i x_n^{i},
    \qquad
    f_i \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}]
  \]
  as $f \in (k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}])[x_n]$.
  Suppose $f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) = 0$ for all $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in k$.
  For fixed $a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}$,
  the polynomial $f(a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}, x_n) \in k[x_n]$ has all distinct roots in
  an infinite field $k$.
  By (1), $f(a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}, x_n) = 0 \in k[x_n]$,
  or each $f_i(a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}) = 0$.
  As all $a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}$ run over $k$,
  we can apply the induction hypothesis
  each $f_i(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}) = 0 \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}]$.
  Hence, $f = 0 \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n}]$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Note.}
If $k$ is a finite field of order $q = p^k$,
then the polynomial $f(x) = x^q - x$ has $q$ distinct roots in $k$. \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.5.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.5.*}
\emph{Let $k$ be any field.
Show that there are an infinitely number of irreducible monic polynomials in $k[x]$.
(Hint: Suppose $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ were all of them, and factor $f_1\cdots f_n+1$ into irreducible factors.)} \\

\emph{Proof (Due to Euclid).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  If
  $f_1, \ldots, f_n$ were all irreducible monic polynomials, then
  we consider
  \[
    g = f_1 \cdots f_n + 1 \in k[x].
  \]
  So there is an irreducible monic polynomial $f = f_i$ dividing $g$ for some $i$
  since
  \[
    \deg g = \deg f_1 + \cdots + \deg f_n \geq 1
  \]
  and $k[x]$ is a UFD.

\item[(2)]
  However, $f$ would divide the difference
  \[
    g - f_1 \cdots f_{i-1} f_i f_{i+1} \cdots f_n = 1,
  \]
  contrary to $\deg f_i \geq 1$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.6.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.6.*}
\emph{Show that any algebraically closed field is infinite.
(Hint: The irreducible monic polynomials are $x - a$, $a \in k$.)} \\

\emph{Proof (Due to Euclid).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field.
  If $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ were all elements in $k$, then
  we consider a monic polynomials
  \[
    f(x) = (x - a_1) \cdots (x - a_n) + 1 \in k[x].
  \]

\item[(2)]
  Since $k$ is algebraically closed,
  there is an element $a \in k$ such that $f(a) = 0$.
  By assumption, $a = a_i$ for some $1 \leq i \leq n$,
  and thus $f(a) = f(a_i) = 1$, contrary to the fact that
  a field is a commutative ring where $0 \neq 1$ and all nonzero elements are invertible.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.7.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.7.*}
\emph{Let $k$ be a field, $f \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in k$.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that}
  \[
    f = \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n-a_n)^{i_n},
    \qquad
    \lambda_{(i)} \in k.
  \]

\item[(b)]
  \emph{If $f(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = 0$,
  show that $f = \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-a_i) g_i$ for some (not unique) $g_i$ in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Regard $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ as $(k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}])[x_n]$.
  Since $(k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}])[x_n]$ is a Euclidean domain with a function
  \[
    f \in (k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}])[x_n] \mapsto \deg_{x_n} f \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}
  \]
  satisfying the division-with-remainder property.

\item[(2)]
  Apply the division algorithm for $f$ and nonzero $x_n-a_n$
  to produce a quotient $q$ and remainder $r$ with
  $f = (x_n-a_n) q + r$ and either $r = 0$ or $\deg_{x_n}(r) < \deg_{x_n} (x_n-a_n) = 1$.
  That is, $r \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$ is a constant in $(k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}])[x_n]$.
  Continue this process to get that $f$ is of the form
  \[
    f = \sum_{i_n} f_{i_n} (x_n - a_n)^{i_n}
  \]
  where $f_{i_n} \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$.

\item[(3)]
  Use the same argument in (2) for each $f_{i_n} \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    f_{i_n}
    &= \sum_{i_{n-1}} \underbrace{f_{i_n,i_{n-1}}}_{\in k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-2}]}
      (x_{n-1} - a_{n-1})^{i_{n-1}} \\
    f_{i_n,i_{n-1}}
    &=
    \sum_{i_{n-2}} \underbrace{f_{i_n,i_{n-1},i_{n-2}}}_{\in k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-3}]}
      (x_{n-2} - a_{n-2})^{i_{n-2}}, \\
    & \cdots \\
    f_{i_n,\ldots,i_{2}}
    &= \sum_{i_1} \underbrace{f_{i_n,\ldots,i_1}}_{\in k} (x_1 - a_1)^{i_1}.
  \end{align*}
  Note that $f_{i_n,\ldots,i_1} \in k$, we can write
  \[
    f = \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n-a_n)^{i_n},
    \qquad
    \lambda_{(i)} \in k.
  \]
  by replacing all $f_{i_n,\ldots,i_k}$ by $f_{i_n,\ldots,i_{k-1}}$
  for $k = n, n-1, \ldots, 2$.

\item[(4)]
  Or use the induction on $n$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \[
    f = \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n-a_n)^{i_n},
    \qquad
    \lambda_{(i)} \in k
  \]
  by (a).

\item[(2)]
  As $f(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0$,
  $\lambda_{(i)} = 0$ if all $i_1, \ldots, i_n$ are zero, that it,
  there is no nonzero constant term in the representation of $f$.
  Hence, for each term
  \[
    f_{(i)} : = \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n-a_n)^{i_n}
  \]
  with $\lambda_{(i)} \neq 0$,
  there exists one $i_k > 0$ for some $1 \leq k \leq n$.
  So we can write
  \[
    f_{(i)}
    =
    (x_k-a_k)
      \underbrace{
        (\lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_k-a_k)^{i_k-1} \cdots (x_n-a_n)^{i_n})}_{
          := g_{(i)} \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]}.
  \]
  Note that the expression of $f_{(i)}$ is not unique since
  there may exist more than one $i_k > 0$ as $1 \leq k \leq n$.

\item[(3)]
  Now we iterate each nonzero term in $f$, apply the factorization in (2),
  and then group by each $x_k-a_k$.
  Therefore, we can write
  \[
    f = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-a_i)g_i
  \]
  for some $g_1 \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$.

\item[(4)]
  The expression of $f$ is not unique.
  For example, take $f(x,y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \in k[x,y]$.
  As $f(0,0) = 0$, we can write
  \begin{align*}
    f(x,y)
    &= x \cdot \underbrace{(x+2y)}_{g_1} + y \cdot \underbrace{y}_{g_2}, \text{ or } \\
    &= x \cdot \underbrace{(x+y)}_{g_1} + y \cdot \underbrace{(x+y)}_{g_2}, \text{ or } \\
    &= x \cdot \underbrace{x}_{g_1} + y \cdot \underbrace{(2x+y)}_{g_2}.
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.8.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.8.*}
\emph{Show that the algebraic subsets of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ are just the finite subsets, together
with $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ itself.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $k[x]$ is a PID if $k$ is a field.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    Let $I$ be an ideal of $k[x]$.

  \item[(b)]
    If $I = \{0\}$ then $I = (0)$ and $I$ is principal.

  \item[(c)]
    If $I \neq \{0\}$, then take $f$ to be a polynomial of minimal degree in $I$.
    It suffices to show that $I = (f)$.
    Clearly, $(f) \subseteq I$ since $I$ is an ideal.
    Conversely, for any $g \in I$,
    \[
      g(x) = f(x)h(x) + r(x)
    \]
    for some $h, r \in k[x]$ with $r = 0$ or $\deg r < \deg f$ (as $k[x]$ is a Euclidean domain).
    Now as
    \[
      r = g - fh \in I,
    \]
    $r = 0$ (otherwise contrary to the minimality of $f$),
    we have $g = fh \in (f)$ for all $g \in I$.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(2)]
  Let $Y$ be an algebraic subset of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$,
  say $Y = V(I)$ for some ideal $I$ of $k[x]$.
  Since $k[x]$ is a PID, $I = (f)$ for some $f \in k[x]$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    If $f = 0$, then $I = (0)$ and $Y = V(0) = \mathbf{A}^1(k)$.

  \item[(b)]
    If $f \neq 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ has finitely many roots in $k$,
    say $a_1, \ldots, a_m \in k$.
    Hence,
    \[
      Y = V(I) = V(f) = \{ f(a) = 0 : a \in k \}
      = \{ a_1, \ldots, a_m \}
    \]
    is a finite subsets of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  By (a)(b), the result is established.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Notes.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  By the Hilbert basis theorem, $k[x]$ is Noetherian as $k$ is Noetherian.
  Hence, for any algebraic subset $Y = V(I)$ of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$,
  we can write $I = (f_1, \cdots, f_m)$.
  Note that
  \[
    Y = V(I) = V(f_1) \cap \cdots \cap V(f_m).
  \]
  Now apply the same argument to get the same conclusion.

\item[(2)]
  Suppose $k = \overline{k}$.
  $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ is irreducible, because its only proper closed subsets are finite,
  yet it is infinite
  (because $k$ is algebraically closed, hence infinite). \\

\emph{If $k$ is a finite field, show that every subset of $\mathbf{A}^{n}(k)$ is algebraic.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Every subset of $\mathbf{A}^{n}(k)$ is finite since
  $|\mathbf{A}^{n}(k)| = |k|^n$ is finite.

\item[(2)]
  Note that $V(x_1-a_1,\ldots,x_n-a_n) = \{ (a_1,\ldots,a_n) \} \subseteq \mathbf{A}^{n}(k)$
  (Property (5) in \S 1.2)
  and any finite union of algebraic sets is algebraic (Property (4) in \S 1.2).
  Thus, every subset of $\mathbf{A}^{n}(k)$ is algebraic (by (1)).

\emph{Give an example of a countable collection of algebraic sets whose union is not
algebraic.} \\

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $k = \mathbb{Q}$ be an infinite field.
  $V(x-a) = \{ a \}$ is an algebraic sets for all $a \in \mathbb{Q}$.
  In particular, $V(x-a) = \{ a \}$ is algebraic for all $a \in \mathbb{Z}$.

\item[(2)]
  Note that
  \[
    Y := \bigcup_{a \in \mathbb{Z}} V(x-a) = \mathbb{Z}
  \]
  is a countable union of algebraic sets.
  Since $Y$ is a proper subset of $k = \mathbb{Q}$,

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.14.*}

\emph{Let $f$ be a nonconstant polynomial in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$,
$k$ algebraically closed.
Show that $\mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - V(f)$ is infinite if $n \geq 1$,
and $V(f)$ is infinite if $n \geq 2$.
Conclude that the complement of any proper algebraic set is infinite.
(Hint: See Problem 1.4.)} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - V(f)$ is infinite if $n \geq 1$.}
  Since $f$ is a nonconstant polynomial in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$,
  we may assume that $\deg_{x_n}(f) > 0$.
  Hence
  \[
    x_n \mapsto f(1,\ldots,1,x_n)
  \]
  is a nonconstant polynomial of degree $\deg_{x_n}(f) > 0$ in $k[x_n]$.
  So $f$ has finitely many roots in $k$, say $\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m$ ($m \geq 0$).
  Hence,
  \[
    (1,\ldots,1,x_n) \neq 0
  \]
  whenever $x_n \neq \xi_m$.
  Such subset in $\mathbf{A}^{1}(k)$ is infinite since $k = \overline{k}$ (Problem 1.6).
  Therefore,
  \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - V(f)
    &=
    \{ (a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) : f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \neq 0 \} \\
    &\supseteq
    \{ a_n  \in \mathbf{A}^{1}(k) : f(1,\ldots,1,x_n) \neq 0 \}
  \end{align*}
  is infinite.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $V(f)$ is infinite if $n \geq 2$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    Similar to (1).
    Since $f$ is a nonconstant polynomial in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$,
    we may assume that $m := \deg_{x_n}(f) > 0$.
    Write
    \[
      f = \sum_{i=0}^{m} f_i(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}) x_n^{i}.
    \]
    Note that each $f_i$ is well-defined since $n \geq 2$.

  \item[(b)]
    If $f_n$ is constant in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$,
    then $f_n$ is nonzero (since $m > 0$) or $V(f_n) = \varnothing$.
    If $f_n$ is nonconstant in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$,
    then the set $\mathbf{A}^{n-1}(k) - V(f_n)$ is infinite by (1).
    In any case,
    \[
      \mathbf{A}^{n-1}(k) - V(f_n)
    \]
    is infinite.

  \item[(c)]
    For each $P = (a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1}) \in \mathbf{A}^{n-1}(k) - V(f_n)$,
    \[
      g_P: x_n \mapsto f(P,x_n) = f(a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1},x_n)
    \]
    defines a polynomial in $k[x_n]$ of degree $m > 0$.
    Since $k = \overline{k}$, $g_P$ has at least one root $Q \in k$.
    Hence
    \[
      V(f) \supseteq
      \{ (P,Q) \in \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) : P \in \mathbf{A}^{n-1}(k) - V(f_n), g_P(Q) = 0 \}
    \]
    is infinite since the set $\mathbf{A}^{n-1}(k) - V(f_n)$ is infinite.
  \end{enumerate}
  \emph{Note.}
  It is not true if $k \neq \overline{k}$.
  For example, $V(x^2+y^2+1) = \varnothing$ in $\mathbf{A}^{2}(\mathbb{R})$.

\item[(3)]
  Note that
  \[
    \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - V(S)
    = \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - \bigcap_{f \in S} V(f)
    = \bigcup_{f \in S}( \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - V(f) ).
  \]
  Thus the complement of any proper algebraic set is infinite by (1).

It is called the \textbf{product} of $V$ and $W$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}

    V &= V(S_V) = \{ P \in \mathbf{A}^n(k) : f(P) = 0 \: \forall f \in S_V \} \\
    W &= V(S_W) = \{ Q \in \mathbf{A}^m(k) : g(Q) = 0 \: \forall g \in S_W \},
  \end{align*}
  where $S_V \subseteq k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ and $S_W \subseteq k[y_1,\ldots,y_m]$.
  It suffices to show that

    V \times W = V(S),
  \]
  where
  $S \subseteq k[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m]$ is the union of $S_V$ and $S_W$.

\item[(2)]
  Here we can identify $S_V$ with the subset of
  $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m]$
  by noting that
  \[
    k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]
    \hookrightarrow (k[y_1,\ldots,y_m])[x_1,\ldots,x_n]
    = k[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m].
  \]
  Here we regard $k$ as a subring of $k[y_1,\ldots,y_m]$.
  Similar treatment to $S_W$.

\item[(3)]
  By construction, $V \times W \subseteq V(S)$.
  Conversely, given any $(P,Q) \in V(S) \subseteq \mathbf{A}^{n+m}(k)$,
  we have $h(P,Q) = 0$ for all $h \in S = S_V \cup S_W$ (by (2)).
  By construction, $f(P) = 0$ for all $f \in S_V$ since $f$ only involve $x_1,\ldots,x_n$.
  Hence, $P \in V$. Similarly, $Q \in W$. Therefore, $(P,Q) \in V \times W$.

  (Proof of Property (6) in \S 1.3.)
  \emph{Show that if $X \subseteq Y$, then $I(X) \supseteq I(Y)$.}
  If $f \in I(Y)$ then $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in Y$.

  $V(I(X)) \supseteq X$ for any set $X$ of points.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    If $f \in S$ then $f$ vanishes on $V(S)$,
    hence $f \in IV(S)$.

  \item[(b)]

    so $P$ belongs to the zero set of $I(X)$.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(3)]
  (Proof of Property (9) in \S 1.3.)
  \emph{$V(I(V(S))) = V(S)$ for any set $S$ of polynomials,
  and $I(V(I(X))) = I(X)$ for any set $X$ of points.
  So if $V$ is an algebraic set, $V = V(I(V))$,
  and if $I$ is the ideal of an algebraic set, $I = I(V(I))$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    In each case, it suffices to show that the left side is a subset of the right side.
    (by Properties (6)(8) in \S 1.3).

  \item[(b)]
    If $P \in V(S)$ then $f(P) = 0$ for all $f \in I(V(S))$, so $P \in V(I(V(S)))$.

  \item[(c)]
    If $f \in I(X)$ then $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in V(I(X))$.
    Thus $f$ vanishes on $V(I(X))$, so $f \in I(V(I(X)))$.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $V = W$ if and only if $I(V) = I(W)$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    By Property (6) in \S 1.3, $I(V) \supseteq I(W)$ if $V \subseteq W$
    and $I(V) \subseteq I(W)$ if $V \supseteq W$.
    Thus, $I(V) = I(W)$ if $V = W$.

  \item[(b)]
    Conversely,
    $I(V) = I(W)$ implies that $V(I(V)) = V(I(W))$
    by Property (3) in \S 1.2 and similar argument in (a).
    By Property (9) in \S 1.3, $V(I(V)) = V$ and $V(I(W)) = W$.

  By definition $a^n \in \mathrm{rad}(I)$ for some positive integer $n$.

\emph{Show that $I = (x^2+1) \subseteq \mathbb{R}[x]$ is a radical (even a prime) ideal,
but $I$ is not the ideal of any set in $\mathbf{A}^1(\mathbb{R})$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $I = (x^2+1)$ is a prime ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x]$.}
  Given any $fg \in I$.
  It suffices to show that $f \in I$ or $g \in I$.
  By definition of $I$,
  there is a polynomial $h \in \mathbb{R}[x]$ such that $fg = (x^2+1)h$.
  So $(x^2+1) \mid f$ or $(x^2+1) \mid g$
  since $x^2+1$ is irreducible in a unique factorization domain $\mathbb{R}[x]$.
  Therefore, $f \in I$ or $g \in I$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $I$ is not the ideal of any set in $\mathbf{A}^1(\mathbb{R})$.}
  Since $x^2+1$ has no roots in $\mathbb{R}$,
  $I$ cannot be the ideal of any nonempty set in $\mathbf{A}^1(\mathbb{R})$.

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $V(I) = V(\mathrm{rad}(I))$.}
  Since $I \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(I)$,
  it suffices to show that $V(I) \subseteq V(\mathrm{rad}(I))$.
  Given any $P \in V(I)$.
  For any $f \in \mathrm{rad}(I)$, $f^n \in I$ for some positive integer $n > 0$.
  Note that
  \[
    0 = (f^n)(P) = f(P)^n
  \]
  since $f^n \in I$ and $P \in V(I)$.
  As $k$ is a domain, $f(P)^n = 0$ implies $f(P) = 0$. So $P \in V(\mathrm{rad}(I))$.

and that the natural homomorphism from $k$ to $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$ is an isomorphism.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $I$ is a maximal ideal.}
  Suppose that $J$ is an ideal such that $J \supsetneq I$.
  Take any $f \in J - I$.
  By Problem 1.7(a),
  \[
    f = \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n - a_n)^{i_n}.
  \]
  As $f \not\in I$, there is a nonzero constant term in $f$, say $\lambda \in k - \{0\}$.
  Note that $f - \lambda \in I \subsetneq J$.
  Hence,
  \[
    \lambda = f - (f - \lambda) \in J
  \]
  since $J$ is an ideal.
  As $\lambda \neq 0$, $J = k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is not a proper ideal containing $I$.

\item[(2)]
  Let $\varphi: k \to k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$ be the natural homomorphism.
  (That is, $\varphi: \lambda \to \lambda + I \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$.)

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $\varphi$ is surjective.}
  Given any $f + I \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$.
  By Problem 1.7(a),
  \[
    f = \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n - a_n)^{i_n}.
  \]
  So
  \begin{align*}
    f + I
    &= \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n - a_n)^{i_n} + I \\
    &= \left(f(a_1,\ldots,a_n)
      + \sum_{\text{nonconstant}} \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n - a_n)^{i_n} \right) + I \\
    &= f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) + I.
  \end{align*}
  (Here the summation over all nonconstant terms is in $I$.)
  Hence
  \[
    \varphi: f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in k \mapsto f + I.
  \]

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $\varphi$ is injective.}
  $\ker(\varphi) = \{ \lambda \in k : \lambda \in I \} = k \cap I = \{0\}$
  since $I$ is a proper ideal.

\item[(5)]
  By (2)(3)(4), $\varphi: k \to k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(x_1-a_1,\ldots,x_n-a_n)$
  is an isomorphism.

\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that for every ideal $J'$ of $R/I$,
  $\pi^{-1}(J') = J$ is an ideal of $R$ containing $I$,
  and for every ideal $J$ of $R$ containing $I$,
  $\pi(J) = J'$ is an ideal of $R/I$.
  This sets up a natural one-to-one correspondence between

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that for every ideal $J'$ of $R/I$,
  $\pi^{-1}(J') = J$ is an ideal of $R$ containing $I$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    \emph{Show that $J$ contains $I$.}
    Note that $\pi^{-1}(0) = I \subseteq \pi^{-1}(J') = J$.
    So $J$ contains $I$. In particular, $J \neq \varnothing$ since $I \neq \varnothing$.

  \item[(b)]
    \emph{Show that $J$ is a additive subgroup of $R$.}
    It suffices to show that
    $a - b \in J$

    Actually,
    \[
      \pi(a - b) = \pi(a) - \pi(b) \in J'

    implies $a - b \in \pi^{-1}(J') = J$.

  \item[(c)]
    \emph{Show that for every $r \in R$ and every $a \in J$,
    the product $ra \in J$.}
    In fact,
    \[
      \pi(ra) = \pi(r) \pi(a) \in J'

    implies $ra \in \pi^{-1}(J') = J$.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that for every ideal $J$ of $R$ containing $I$,
  $\pi(J) = J'$ is an ideal of $R/I$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    \emph{Show that $J'$ is nonempty.}
    Note that $\pi(a) = 0 \in \pi(I) \subseteq \pi(J) = J'$ for any $a \in I$.
    So $J'$ is nonempty since $J$ is nonempty.

  \item[(b)]
    \emph{Show that $J'$ is a additive subgroup of $R/I$.}
    It suffices to show that
    $\pi(a) - \pi(b) \in J'$ for any $\pi(a) \in J'$, $\pi(b) \in J'$, $a \in J$ and $b \in J$.
    It is trivial since
    \[
      \pi(a) - \pi(b) = \pi(a - b) \in \pi(J) = J',
    \]
    $\pi$ is a ring homomorphism and $J$ is an ideal.

  \item[(c)]
    \emph{Show that for every $\pi(r) \in R/I$ ($r \in R$) and every $\pi(a) \in J'$ ($a \in J$),
    the product $\pi(r)\pi(a) \in J'$.}
    It is trivial since
    \[
      \pi(r)\pi(a) = \pi(ra) \in \pi(J) = J',
    \]
    $\pi$ is a ring homomorphism and $J$ is an ideal.

\item[(3)]
  By (1)(2), we setup the correspondence between
  \[
    \{ \text{ideals of $R/I$} \}
    \longleftrightarrow
    \{ \text{ideals of $R$ that contain $I$} \}.
  \]
  Note that this correspondence preserves the subset relation,
  and thus this correspondence is one-to-one.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $J'$ is radical if $J$ is radical.}
  It suffices to show that $(a + I)^n = a^n + I \in J'$ implies that $a + I \in J'$.
  Note that
  \[
    (a + I)^n = a^n + I \in J'
  \]
  implies that $a^n \in J$ or $a \in J$ since $J$ is radical.
  Hence $a + I \in J/I = J'$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $J$ is radical if $J'$ is radical.}
  It suffices to show that $a^n \in J$ implies that $a \in J$.
  Note that
  \[
    \pi(a^n) = \pi(a)^n \in J'
  \]
  implies that $\pi(a) \in J'$ since $J'$ is radical.
  $a \in \pi^{-1}(J') = J$.

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $J'$ is prime if $J$ is prime.}
  It suffices to show that
  $(a + I)(b + I) = ab + I \in J'$ implies that $a + I \in J'$ or $b + I \in J'$.
  Note that
  \[
    (a + I)(b + I) = ab + I \in J'
  \]
  implies that $ab \in J$. So $a \in J$ or $b \in J$ by the primality of $J$.
  Hence $a + I \in J'$ or $b + I \in J'$.

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $J$ is prime if $J'$ is prime.}
  It suffices to show that $ab \in J$ implies that $a \in J$ or $b \in J$.
  Note that
  \[
    \pi(ab) = \pi(a)\pi(b) \in J'
  \]
  implies that $\pi(a) \in J'$ or $\pi(b) \in J'$ by the primality of $J'$.
  So $a \in \pi^{-1}(J') = J$ or $b \in \pi^{-1}(J') = J$.

\item[(5)]
  \emph{Show that $J'$ is maximal if $J$ is maximal.}
  Suppose $\mathfrak{m}$ is an ideal containing $J'$.
  By (a), $\pi^{-1}(\mathfrak{m})$ is an ideal containing $J$.
  So $\pi^{-1}(\mathfrak{m}) = J$ or $\pi^{-1}(\mathfrak{m}) = R$ by the maximality of $J$.
  Hence, $\mathfrak{m} = \pi(J) = J'$ or $\mathfrak{m} = \pi(R) = R/I$.

\item[(6)]
  \emph{Show that $J$ is maximal if $J'$ is maximal.}
  Suppose $\mathfrak{m}$ is an ideal containing $J$.
  By (a), $\pi(\mathfrak{m})$ is an ideal containing $J'$.
  So $\pi(\mathfrak{m}) = J'$ or $\pi(\mathfrak{m}) = R/I$ by the maximality of $J'$.
  Hence, $\mathfrak{m} = \pi^{-1}(J') = J$ or $\mathfrak{m} = \pi^{-1}(R/I) = R$.

\emph{Note.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Note that
  \[
    R/J \cong (R/I)/(J/I)
  \]
  if $J$ is an ideal of $R$ such that $I \subseteq J$.

\item[(2)]
  Hence, $J$ is prime iff $R/J \cong (R/I)/(J/I)$ is a domain iff $J/I$ is prime.

\item[(3)]
  Also, $J$ is maximal iff $R/J \cong (R/I)/(J/I)$ is a field iff $J/I$ is maximal. \\

\emph{Proof of (c).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $J'$ is finitely generated if $J$ is.}
  Suppose $J$ is generated by $a_1, \ldots, a_m$.
  It suffices to show that $J'$ is generated by
  \[
    a_1 + I, \ldots, a_m + I \in J/I.
  \]
  Given any $a + I \in J'$ where $a \in J$.
  Write $a = \sum_{1 \leq i \leq m} r_i a_i$ for some $r_i \in R$.
  Then
  \[
    a + I = \sum r_i a_i + I = \sum (r_i + I)(a_i + I)

  is generated by $a_1 + I, \ldots, a_m + I$.

  By the corollary to the Hilbert basis theorem,
  $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is Noetherian.
  By (2), the ring $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$ is Noetherian.

  \emph{Show that $f$ is an irreducible polynomial.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    Suppose
    \[
      f = (f_2(x) y^2 + f_1(x) y + f_0(x)) \cdot g(x)

      f_1(x)g(x) = 0,
      \qquad
      f_0(x)g(x) = x^2(x-1)^2.

    So $f_1(x) = u$, $g_1(x) = u^{-1}$ for some unit $u \in \mathbb{R}$.

\emph{Let $k = \mathbb{R}$.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that $I(V(x^2+y^2+1))=(1)$.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that every algebraic subset of $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$ is equal to $V(f)$
  for some $f \in \mathbb{R}[x,y]$.}
\end{enumerate}
\emph{This indicates why we usually require that $k$ be algebraically closed.} \\



\emph{Proof of (a).}
$I(V(x^2+y^2+1)) = I(\varnothing) = (1)$
since $x^2+y^2+1 \geq 1$ is never zero for any $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$.
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Given any algebraic subset $V$ of $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.
  $V = V(1)$ if $V = \varnothing$.
  $V = V(0)$ if $V = \mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.
  Now suppose $V$ is a nonempty proper algebraic subset $V$ of $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.
  Write $V = V_1 \cup \cdots \cup V_m$,
  where each $V_i$ is irreducible.
  Here $V_i \neq \varnothing$ and $V_i \neq \mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$ for all $i$.

\item[(2)]
  As $k = \mathbb{R}$ is infinite,
  Corollary 2 to Proposition 2 implies that each $V_i$ is either a point
  or an irreducible plane curves $V(f_i)$,
  where $f_i$ is an irreducible polynomial and $V(f_i)$ is infinite.

\item[(3)]
  If $V_i = \{ (a_i,b_i) \}$ is a point, then define
  \[
    f_i(x,y) = (x-a_i)^2 + (x-b_i)^2.
  \]
  By the property of $\mathbb{R}$, $V_i = V(f_i)$.

\item[(4)]
  Define $f = f_1 \cdots f_m \in \mathbb{R}[x,y]$.
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    V

    &= V(f_1) \cup \cdots \cup V(f_m) \\

  Note that
  \begin{align*}
    V(y^2-xy-x^2y+x^3)

  Also, $V(y-x^2)$ and $V(y - x)$ are infinite in $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$
  and thus also in $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$.

\item[(3)]
  Therefore,
  $V(y-x^2)$ and $V(y - x)$ are the irreducible components of $V(y^2-xy-x^2y+x^3)$
  in $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$ and also in $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$.

\emph{Outline of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  The elliptic curve $V(y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1))$ is irreducible over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.

\item[(2)]
  The elliptic curve $V(y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1))$ is irreducible over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$.

\item[(3)]
  The irreducible component of $V(x^3+x-x^2y-y)$ over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$ is $V(x - y)$.

\item[(4)]
  The irreducible components of $V(x^3+x-x^2y-y)$ over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$ are
  $V(x + i)$, $V(x - i)$ and $V(x - y)$. \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Similar to Problem 1.25.
  To show $y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1)$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$,
  we write
  \[
    y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1) \in (\mathbb{C}[x])[y].
  \]
  Note that $\mathbb{C}[x]$ is a UFD and $-x(x+1)(x-1)$ is the constant term.
  As $\mathbb{C}[x]/(x) \cong \mathbb{C}$ is a domain, $(x)$ is prime.
  Clearly, $x \mid x(x+1)(x-1)$ but $x^2 \nmid x(x+1)(x-1)$.
  By the Eisenstein's criterion,
  we can say $y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1)$ is irreducible over $(\mathbb{C}[x])[y]$.

\item[(2)]
  Moreover, $V(y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1))$ is infinite over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$
  and thus also over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$.
  ($y = f(x) = \sqrt{x(x+1)(x-1)}$ is continuous and strictly increasing on $[1,\infty)$
  in the sense of calculus.
  As the measure of $[1,\infty)$ is $\infty$, the set $V(y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1))$ is infinite
  over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.)

\item[(3)]
  By Corollary 1 to Proposition 2,
  $V(y^2 - x(x^2-1))$ itself is irreducible over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$
  or $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$.

\item[(4)]
  Consider $V(x^3+x-x^2y-y) \subseteq \mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.
  \begin{align*}
    V(x^3+x-x^2y-y)
    &= V((x^2 + 1)(x - y)) \\
    &= V(x^2 + 1) \cup V(x - y) \\
    &= \varnothing \cup V(x - y) \\
    &= V(x - y).
  \end{align*}
  Here we use that fact that
  $x^2 + 1 = 0$ has no real solution $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
  Similar to (a), $V(x - y)$ is the only irreducible component of $V(x^3+x-x^2y-y)$
  in $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.

\item[(5)]
  Consider $V(x^3+x-x^2y-y) \subseteq \mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$.
  \begin{align*}
    V(x^3+x-x^2y-y)
    &= V((x + i)(x - i)(x - y)) \\
    &= V(x + i) \cup V(x - i) \cup V(x - y).
  \end{align*}
  Similar to (a), $V(x \pm i)$ and $V(x - y)$ are the irreducible components of $V(x^3+x-x^2y-y)$
  in $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.32.}
\emph{Show that both theorems and all of the corollaries are false
if $k$ is not algebraically closed.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Weak Nullstellensatz:
  $I = (x^2+1)$ is a proper ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ but $V(I) = \varnothing$.

\item[(2)]
  Hilbert's Nullstellensatz:
  Let $I = (y^2 + x^2(x-1)^2)$ be an ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$.
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    I(V(I))
    &= I(\{ (0,0), (1,0) \})
      &(\text{Problem 1.26.}) \\
    &= (x(x-1),y) \\
    &\neq I \\
    &= \mathrm{rad}(I).
  \end{align*}
  The last equality holds since $f$ is irreducible in a UFD $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$
  and thus $I$ is a prime ideal.

\item[(3)]
  Corollary 1: Same example in the case Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.
  If $I = (y^2 + x^2(x-1)^2)$ is a radical ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$.
  Then $I(V(I)) \neq I$.

\item[(4)]
  Corollary 2: Same example in the case Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.
  If $I = (y^2 + x^2(x-1)^2)$ is a prime ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$,
  then
  \[
    V(I) = \{ (0,0), (1,0) \} = V(x,y) \cup V(x-1,y)
  \]
  is reducible.
  Next, consider a prime ideal $J = (x^2+y^2)$ in $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$.
  (Use the same argument in Problem 1.26 to get the irreducibility of $x^2+y^2$.)
  $V(J) = \{ (0,0) \}$ is a point but $J$ is not a maximal ideal
  (since $J \subsetneq (x^2+y^2,x) \subsetneq (1)$).

\item[(5)]
  Corollary 3: Same example in Corollary 2.

\item[(6)]
  Corollary 4:
  Let $I = (x^2 + y^2)$ be an ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$.
  Then $V(I) = \{ (0,0) \}$ is a finite set.
  But $\mathbb{R}[x,y]/(x^2 + y^2)$ is an infinite dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{R}$.
  In fact, the monomials
  \[
    \{ \overline{x^m}, \overline{x^m y} : m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \}
  \]
  is a basis for $\mathbb{R}[x,y]/(x^2 + y^2)$.

  \end{align*}
  By the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz,
  it suffices to show that $(x^2+y^2-1, y + iz)$ and $(x^2+y^2-1, y - iz)$ are prime.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $I = (x^2+y^2-1, y + iz)$ is prime in $\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]$.}
  Note that

  So it suffices to show that
  \[
    x^2+y^2-1 \in \mathbb{C}[x,y]

  is irreducible.
  (Thus, $\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(x^2+y^2-1) \cong \mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/I$ is a domain, or $I$ is prime.)

  $x^2+y^2-1 = y^2 + (x+1)(x-1)$ is irreducible
  as showing the irreducibility of $y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1)$.

\item[(3)]
  Similarly, $I = (x^2+y^2-1, y - iz)$ is prime.

  It is equivalent to show that

\item[(2)]
  Suppose $f$ is reducible of degree $2$ or $3$.
  Then there exist nonconstant monic polynomials $g, h \in R[x]$ such that $f = gh$.
  By
  \[
    \deg(g) + \deg(h) = \deg(f) = 2 \text{ or } 3,
  \]
  we may assume that $\deg(g) = 1$. (Otherwise $g$ or $h$ will be a constant polynomial.)
  Say $g(x) = x - a$ where $a \in R$.
  Now
  \[
    f(a) = g(a)h(a) = 0

  implies that $a \in R$ is a root of $f$.

\item[(3)]
  Conversely, if $a \in R$ is a root of $f$, then
  apply the same argument in Problem 1.7 we can write
  \[
    f = (x - a)g

  for some $g \in R[x]$.
  Here $\deg(g) \geq 1$ since $\deg(f) = 1 + \deg(g) \geq 2$.
  Therefore, $f$ is reducible.

  $x^2-a \in R[x]$ is reducible $\Longleftrightarrow$

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Clearly, $V(I) = \{ (0,0) \}$ is a finite set.
  By Corollary 4 to the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz,

  In fact, $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}(\mathbb{C}[x,y]/I) = 4$.

  Given any $f + I \in \mathbb{C}[x,y]/I$ where $f \in \mathbb{C}[x,y]$.
  Write

    f(x,y) = \sum_{i} f_i(x) y^i

    f(x,y) + I

  We can regard any linear combination of $\{ 1, x, \ldots, x^{n-1} \}$

  $r \in (f)$ implies that there exists a polynomial $g \in K[x]$

  If $g \neq 0$, then $\deg(r) = \deg(f) + \deg(g) \geq n$, which is impossible.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Given any algebraic subset $W$ of $V$.

    I(W) \supseteq I(V) = \mathrm{rad}(I) \supseteq I.

\item[(a)]
  \emph{Let $R$ be a UFD, and let $\mathfrak{p} = (t)$ be a principal proper prime ideal.
  Show that there is no prime ideal $\mathfrak{q}$
  such that $0 \subsetneq \mathfrak{q} \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}$.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Let $V = V(f)$ be irreducible hypersurface in $\mathbf{A}^n$.
  Show that there is no irreducible algebraic set $W$ such that
  $V \subsetneq W \subsetneq \mathbf{A}^n$.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  Suppose that $\mathfrak{q}$ were a prime ideal in $R$ such that
  $0 \subsetneq \mathfrak{q} \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that there is an irreducible element in $\mathfrak{q}$.}
  Given any $q \in \mathfrak{q}$. Since $\mathfrak{q}$ is proper,
  we can write
  \[
    q = q_1 \cdots q_n
  \]
  as a product of irreducible elements in a UFD.
  Since $\mathfrak{q}$ is prime, there is one irreducible element $q_i \in \mathfrak{q}$.

\item[(3)]
  Now $q_i \in \mathfrak{q} \subseteq \mathfrak{p} = (t)$.
  So $q_i = ut$ for some $u \in R$.
  By the irreducibility of $q_i$, $u$ is a unit or $t$ is a unit.
  If $u$ is a unit, then
  \[
    (t) = (q_i) \subseteq \mathfrak{q} \subseteq \mathfrak{p} = (t).
  \]
  So $\mathfrak{q} = \mathfrak{p}$, which is absurd.
  If $t$ is a unit, then $\mathfrak{p} = (1)$, contrary to the primality of $\mathfrak{p}$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  We might assume that $k = \overline{k}$.
  By Corollary 3 to the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and the irreducibility of $V(f)$,
  there are an irreducible polynomial $g \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ and an integer $m > 0$
  such that
  \[
    f = g^m,
  \]
  and
  \[
    I(V(f)) = (g).
  \]

\item[(2)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  Suppose that there were an irreducible algebraic set $W$ such that
  $V \subsetneq W \subsetneq \mathbf{A}^n$.
  Then by Corollary 3 to the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz again,
  \[
    (g) = I(V(f)) \supsetneq I(W) \supsetneq (1) \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n].
  \]
  Here $(g) = I(V(f))$ and $I(W)$ are all prime.

\item[(3)]
  Note that $(g)$ is a principal proper prime ideal in a UFD $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.
  By (a), such ideal $I(W)$ cannot be prime, which is absurd.

  In any case,
  $r = x r_1 + r_0$ for some $r_1, r_0 \in k[y,z]$.

  Apply the same argument to (1),

\item[(3)]
  By $\overline{r_0} = \overline{y c} + \overline{a}$
  and $\overline{r_1} = \overline{y d} + \overline{b}$,
  \begin{align*}
    \overline{f}
    &= \overline{r} \\

    &= \overline{x} (\overline{y d} + \overline{b}) + (\overline{y c} + \overline{a}) \\

      + \overline{c} \cdot \overline{y} + \overline{d} \cdot \overline{xy}.
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
  As $0 = \alpha(f) = a + ct^6 + bt^9 + dt^{15} \in k[t]$,
  $a = b = c = d = 0 \in k$.
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (c).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $I \subseteq \ker(\alpha)$ is trivial.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $\ker(\alpha) \subseteq I$.}
  Take any $f \in \ker(\alpha)$, or $\alpha(f) = 0$.
  By (a), $f = r + f_1$ where $f_1 \in I$ and $r = a + bx + cy + dxy \in k[x,y,z]$
  for some $a, b, c, d \in k[z]$.
  Note that $\alpha$ is a ring homomorphism.
  Therefore,
  \[
    0 = \alpha(f) = \alpha(r + f_1) = \alpha(r) + \alpha(g) = \alpha(r).
  \]
  By (b), $r = 0 \in k[x,y,z]$ and thus $f = f_1 \in I$.

\item[(3)]
  Therefore,
  \[
    \alpha: k[x,y,z]/(x^2-y^3, y^2-z^3) \hookrightarrow k[t]
  \]
  is injective.

  Suppose that $L$ were ring-finite over $K$.

  Given any $t \in T = \sum S w_j$.
  There are some $s_j \in S$ such that $t = \sum_{j} s_j w_j$.

  \emph{Show that any element of $L$ that is integral over $K[x]$ is already in $K[x]$.
  (Hint: If $z^n + a_1 z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n = 0$, write $z = f/g$,
  $f, g$ relatively prime. Then $f^n + a_1 f^{n-1}g + \cdots + a_n g^n = 0$,
  So $g$ divides $f$.)}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that there is no nonzero element $f \in K[x]$ such that for
  every $z \in L$, $f^n z$ is integral over $K[x]$ for some $n > 0$. (Hint: See Problem 1.44.)} \\

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Note that $0$ is integral over $K[x]$ and $0 \in K[x]$ trivially.

\item[(2)]
  Now we take any nonzero element $z \in L = K(x)$ which is integral over $K[x]$.
  So $z^n + a_1 z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n = 0$ for some $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in K[x]$
  and $a_n \neq 0$ (since $z \neq 0$).

\item[(3)]
  Write $z = f/g$, $f, g$ relatively prime in $K[x]$.
  Then
  \[
    f^n + a_1 f^{n-1}g + \cdots + a_n g^n = 0 \in K[x].
  \]
  Since $a_n \neq 0$, $g \mid f^n$ or $g \mid f$ or $g = 1 \in K$.
  Therefore, $z = f \in K[x]$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  Suppose there were a nonzero element $f \in K[x]$ such that for
  every $z \in L$, $f^n z$ is integral over $K[x]$ for some $n > 0$.

\item[(2)]
  Let $z = 1/g \in K(x)$, where $g$ is an irreducible polynomial not dividing $f$.
  The existence of $g$ is guaranteed by Problem 1.5.

\item[(3)]
  By the hypothesis in (1), there is an integer $n > 0$ such that
  $f^n z$ is integral over $K[x]$.
  By (a), $f^n z = f^n/g$ is also in $K[x]$. So $g \mid f^n$ or $g \mid f$,

\begin{enumerate}

  Let $R$ be the set of elements of $L$ that are algebraic over $K$.
  By Corollary to Proposition 3, $R$ is a subring of $L$ containing $K$.
  (Note that $K$ is a field.)
  So it suffices to show that $v^{-1} \in R$ if $v \in R - \{0\}$.

  for some $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in K$ and $a_n \neq 0$.
  So

  Here $v^{-1} = \left(- \frac{1}{a_n} v^{n-1} - \cdots - \frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} \right)$

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $(f)$ is a prime ideal in a UFD $K[x]$ since $f$ is irreducible.
  Note that $K[x]$ is also a PID, $(f)$ is maximal (Problem 1.3).
  Hence $L = K[x]/(f)$ is a field.

  $\mathrm{im}(\alpha) = K(y)$ clearly.

\item[(2)]
  Note that $\mathrm{ker}(\alpha)$ is an ideal containing $(f)$ since $\alpha(f) = 0$.
  $\mathrm{ker}(\alpha)$ is proper since $\alpha(1) = 1 \neq 0$.
  By the maximality of $(f)$, $\mathrm{ker}(\alpha) = (f)$.

$L$ is called a \textbf{splitting field} of $F$.} \\

  Let $p(x) \in K[x]$ be an irreducible factor of $f(x) \in K[x]$,
  and let $L'$ be the field $K[x]/(p(x))$ (by Problem 1.51(a)).

  Then we might regard $K$ as a subfield of $L'$
  by sending $a \in K$ to $\overline{a} = a + (p(x)) \in L'$.

\item[(3)]
  By Problem 1.51(a), $\overline{x}$ is a root of $p \in L'$;
  therefore is a root of $f$.

\item[(4)]
  Induction on $n$. By (1)(2)(3), there is a field $L' \supseteq K$

Let $L$ be a splitting field of $f$,
so $f = \prod_{i=1}^{n} (x - x_i)$, $x_i \in L$.
Show that the $x_i$ are distinct.
(Hint: Apply Problem 1.51(c) to $g = f_x$;
if $(x - \overline{x})^2$ divides $f$, then $g(\overline{x}) = 0$.)} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Since $f \in K[x]$ is irreducible over $K$,
  $\gcd(f, f_x)$ is $1$ or $f$.
  As $\mathrm{char}(K) = 0$, $\deg(f_x) = \deg(f) - 1$.
  So $f$ does not divide $f_x$ or $\gcd(f, f_x) = 1$.
  Hence, there are polynomials $g, h \in K[x]$ such that
  \[
    1 = f g + f_x h.
  \]
  This equation is also true in $L[x]$.

\item[(2)]
  Note that
  \begin{align*}

    f_x &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x - x_1) \cdots \widehat{(x - x_i)} \cdots (x - x_n) \in L[x].

  If $\overline{x}$ were a multiple root of $f$,
  then $f(\overline{x}) = f_x(\overline{x}) = 0$.
  By (1),
  \[
    1 = f(\overline{x}) g(\overline{x}) + f_x(\overline{x}) h(\overline{x}) = 0,

  \emph{Show that there is a basis $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ for $L$ over $K$ (as a vector space)
  such that each $v_i$ is integral over $R$.} \\

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Take any $v \in L$, which is algebraic over $K$.
  Write
  \[
    v^n + a_1 v^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n = 0
  \]
  for some $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in K$ and $a_n \neq 0$.
  Since $K$ is the quotient field of $R$,
  there is a common denominator $a \in R$ of $a_1, \ldots, a_n$.
  Here $a \neq 0$ and $aa_i \in R$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$.

\item[(2)]

      + \underbrace{a^{n-1}(aa_n)}_{\in R} = 0.
  \end{align*}
  $av$ is integral over $R$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Since $L$ be a finite algebraic extension of $K$,
  there exists a basis
  \[
    \{ w_1, \ldots, w_n \}
  \]
  for $L$ over $K$ (as a vector space).

\item[(2)]
  For each $w_i \in L$, there is a nonzero $a_i \in R$ such that
  $a_i w_i$ is integral over $R$ (by (a)).
  So it suffices to show that
  \[
    \{ a_1 w_1, \ldots, a_n w_n \}
  \]
  is also a basis for $L$ over $K$.

\item[(3)]
  Suppose
  \[

  \]
  for some $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in K$.
  Since $\{ w_1, \ldots, w_n \}$ is a basis,
  $\alpha_i a_i = 0$ for all $i$, or $\alpha_i = 0$ for all $i$ (since all $a_i \neq 0$).
  Hence $\{ a_1 w_1, \ldots, a_n w_n \}$ is linearly independent.

\item[(4)]
  Also,
  for any $w \in L$, we can write
  \begin{align*}
    w
    &= \underbrace{\beta_1}_{\in K} w_1 + \cdots + \underbrace{\beta_n}_{\in K} w_n \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $\Gamma(V) = k[x,y]/(f)$ is well-defined since $f$ is irreducible.
  Define a ring homomorphism $\alpha: k[x] \to \Gamma(V) = k[x,y]/(f)$

  If there were a nonzero polynomial $g \in k[x]$ such that $\alpha(g) = 0$,

  Hence
  \[
    0 = \deg_y(g) = \deg_y(f) + \deg_y(h) \geq n > 0,

\emph{Let $\varphi: V \to W$, $\psi: W \to Z$.
Show that $\widetilde{\psi \circ \varphi} = \widetilde{\varphi} \circ \widetilde{\psi}$.
Show that the composition of polynomial maps is a polynomial map.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\widetilde{\psi \circ \varphi} = \widetilde{\varphi} \circ \widetilde{\psi}$.}
  It is equivalent to show that
  \[
    (\widetilde{\psi \circ \varphi})(f) = (\widetilde{\varphi} \circ \widetilde{\psi})(f)
  \]
  for all $f \in \mathscr{F}(Z,k)$.
  In fact,
  \begin{align*}
    (\widetilde{\psi \circ \varphi})(f)
    &= f \circ \psi \circ \varphi, \\
    (\widetilde{\varphi} \circ \widetilde{\psi})(f)
    &= \widetilde{\varphi} ( \widetilde{\psi}(f) )
    = \widetilde{\varphi} ( f \circ \psi )
    = f \circ \psi \circ \varphi.
  \end{align*}

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that the composition of polynomial maps is a polynomial map.}
  Say $V \subseteq \mathbf{A}^n, W \subseteq \mathbf{A}^m, Z \subseteq \mathbf{A}^r$.
  Since $\varphi$ (resp. $\psi$) is a polynomial map,
  there are polynomials $t_1,\ldots,t_m \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
  (resp. $s_1,\ldots,s_r \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_m]$)
  such that
  \begin{align*}
    \varphi(P)
    &= (t_1(P),\ldots,t_m(P)) \\
    \psi(Q)
    &= (s_1(Q),\ldots,s_r(Q))
  \end{align*}
  for all $P \in V$ (resp. $Q \in W$).
  Hence the composition $\psi \circ \varphi$ is
  \begin{align*}
    (\psi \circ \varphi)(P)
    =& \: \psi(\varphi(P)) \\
    =& \: \psi(t_1(P),\ldots,t_m(P)) \\
    =& \: (s_1(t_1(P),\ldots,t_m(P)), \ldots, s_r(t_1(P),\ldots,t_m(P))).
  \end{align*}
  So there are polynomials $y_1,\ldots,y_r \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
  defined by
  \[
    y_i(P) = s_i(t_1(P),\ldots,t_m(P))
  \]
  for all $(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in \mathbf{A}^n$
  such that
  \[
    (\psi \circ \varphi)(P)
    = (y_1(P),\ldots,y_r(P)).
  \]
  (Note that the composition of polynomials is a polynomials.)
  Hence $\psi \circ \varphi$ is a polynomial map.

If $\varphi^{-1}(X)$ is irreducible,
and $X$ is contained in the image of $\varphi$, show that $X$ is irreducible.
This gives a useful test for irreducibility.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\varphi^{-1}(X) = V(\widetilde{\varphi}(I(X)))$ is algebraic.}
  \begin{align*}
    P \in \varphi^{-1}(X)
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    \varphi(P) \in X \\
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    f(\varphi(P)) = 0 \: \forall f \in I(X) \\

    g(P) = 0 \: \forall g \in \widetilde{\varphi}(I(X)) \\
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    P \in V(\widetilde{\varphi}(I(X))).
  \end{align*}
  Also note that $\widetilde{\varphi}(I(X))$ is an ideal in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
  since $\varphi$ is a polynomial map.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{If $\varphi^{-1}(X)$ is irreducible,
  and $X$ is contained in the image of $\varphi$, show that $X$ is irreducible.}
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  Suppose that $X$ were reducible or $I(X)$ were not prime.
  So that there exist two polynomials $f_1, f_2 \not\in I(X)$ but $f_1 f_2 \in I(X)$.
  By definition of $I(X)$, there exist two points $P_1, P_2 \in X$
  such that $f_i(P_i) \neq 0$ for $i = 1, 2$.

\item[(3)]
  Since $X$ is contained in the image of $\varphi$,
  there are two corresponding points $Q_1, Q_2 \in \varphi^{-1}(X)$ such that
  $\varphi(Q_i) = P_i$.
  So $\widetilde{\varphi}(f_i)(Q_i) = f_i(P_i) \neq 0$,
  or $\widetilde{\varphi}(f_i) \not\in I(\varphi^{-1}(X))$.
  However
  \[
    \widetilde{\varphi}(f_1)\widetilde{\varphi}(f_2)
    = \widetilde{\varphi}(f_1 f_2)
    \in I(\varphi^{-1}(X))

  since $f_1 f_2 \in I(X)$,
  contrary to the primality of $I(\varphi^{-1}(X))$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that $\{ (t,t^2,t^3) \in \mathbf{A}^3(k) : t \in k \}$ is an affine variety.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that $V(xz-y^2, yz - x^3, z^2-x^2y) \subseteq \mathbf{A}^3(\mathbb{C})$ is a variety.
  (Hint: $y^3-x^4$, $z^3-x^5$, $z^4-y^5 \in I(V)$.
  Find a polynomial map from $\mathbf{A}^1(\mathbb{C})$ onto $V$.)} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $Y := \{ (t,t^2,t^3) \in \mathbf{A}^3(k) : t \in k \}$ be the twisted cubic curve.
  By Problem 2.7, it suffices to show that
  there is a polynomial map from $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ onto $Y$.
  Here we use the fact that $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ is irreducible as $k = \overline{k}$ is infinite
  (by Problem 1.29).

\item[(2)]
  Define a mapping $\varphi$ from $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ to $Y$ by
  $\varphi(t) = (t,t^2,t^3) \in Y$.
  $\varphi$ is a polynomial map. Also, $\varphi$ is surjective.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\

\emph{Note.}
  Also see Problems 1.11 and 1.33 (for the case $k = \mathbb{C}$). \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  We prove for any algebraically closed field $k$.

\item[(2)]
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    V &= V(xz-y^2, yz - x^3, z^2-x^2y), \\
    Y &= \{ (t^3,t^4,t^5) \in \mathbf{A}^3(k) : t \in k \}.
  \end{align*}
  We want to show that $Y = V$. $Y \subseteq V$ is trivial.
  Now given any $(x,y,z) \in V$.
  If $x = 0$, then $y = z = 0$. So $(x,y,z) = (0,0,0) \in Y$.
  If $x \neq 0$, define
  \[
    t = \frac{y}{x} \in k.
  \]
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    t^3 &= \frac{y^3}{x^3} = \frac{y(xz)}{x^3} = \frac{yz}{x^2} = \frac{x^3}{x^2} = x, \\
    t^4 &= tx = y, \\
    t^5 &= ty = \frac{y^2}{x} = \frac{xz}{x} = z.
  \end{align*}

\item[(3)]
  Same as (a).
  Define a mapping $\varphi$ from $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ to $Y = V$
  by $\varphi(t) = (t^3,t^4,t^5) \in Y = V$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Note.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  We don't use the hint.

\item[(2)]
  In fact, it is easy to show that
  \[
    Y = V(y^3-x^4, z^3-x^5, z^4-y^5).
  \]

\item[(3)]
  $I(V)$ is a prime ideal of height $2$ in $k[x,y,z]$
  which cannot be generated by $2$ elements.
  We say $V$ is \textbf{not a local complete intersection}. \\\\

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 2.23*}
\emph{Show that the order function on $K$ is independent of the choice of uniformizing parameter.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that a uniformizing parameter is unique up to a unit.}
  Suppose $t$ and $t'$ are two uniformizing parameters
  for a discrete valuation ring $R$ with the quotient field $K$.
  Since $R$ is a DVR, the maximal ideal is
  \[
    \mathfrak{m} = (t) = (s).
  \]
  As $s \in (t)$, there is an element $a \in R$ such that $s = at$.
  As $s$ is irreducible (by the maximality of $\mathfrak{m}$),
  $a$ is a unit or $t$ is a unit (which is impossible).
  Hence $s = at$ for some unit $a \in R$.

\item[(2)]
  For any $z \in K$, write
  \[
    z = ut^n = v{s}^{m}
  \]
  for some units $u, v$ and integers $n \geq m$. (The case $n \leq m$ is similar.)
  Replace $s = at$ to get $u t^n = v a^m t^m$.
  So $t^{n - m} = u^{-1}v a^m$ is a unit.
  Hence, $m = n$, or the order function on $K$ is independent of the choice of uniformizing parameter.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\

\emph{Let $R$ be a DVR with quotient field $K$, $\mathrm{ord}$ the order function on $K$.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{If $\mathrm{ord}(a) < \mathrm{ord}(b)$,
  show that $\mathrm{ord}(a + b) = \mathrm{ord}(a)$.}
\item[(b)]
  \emph{If $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in K$, and for some $i$,
  $\mathrm{ord}(a_i) < \mathrm{ord}(a_j)$ (all $j \neq i$),
  then $a_1 + \cdots + a_n \neq 0$.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $t$ be a uniformizing parameter for $R$.
  Given any $a, b \in K$.
  Write $a = ut^n, b = vt^m$ where $u, v$ are units in $R$ and $n, m$ are integers.

\item[(2)]
  Since $\mathrm{ord}(a) < \mathrm{ord}(b)$, $n < m$.
  Hence,
  \[
    a + b = (u + vt^{m-n}) t^n.
  \]
  To show that $\mathrm{ord}(a + b) = \mathrm{ord}(a) = n$,
  it suffices to show that $u + vt^{m-n}$ is a unit in $R$.

\item[(3)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  Suppose that $u + vt^{m-n}$ were not a unit.
  Since $R$ is local, the maximal ideal $(t)$ contains all nonunit elements in $R$.
  Hence, $u + vt^{m-n} \in (t)$. As $m - n > 0$, $vt^{m-n} \in (t)$
  and thus a unit $u \in (t)$, contrary to the maximality of $(t)$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Might assume that $\mathrm{ord}(a_1) < \mathrm{ord}(a_j)$ (all $j \neq 1$).
  In particular, $\mathrm{ord}(a_1) < \infty$.

\item[(2)]
  Similar to (a).
  Let $t$ be a uniformizing parameter for $R$.
  Write $a_i = u_i t^{m_i}$ where $u_i$ are units in $R$ and $m_i$ are integers.
  ($i = 1, \ldots, n$.)
  Since $\mathrm{ord}(a_1) < \mathrm{ord}(a_j)$ (all $j \neq 1$), $m_1 < m_j$.
  Hence,
  \[
    a_1 + \cdots + a_n
    = (u_1
      + \underbrace{u_2 t^{m_2 - m_1} + \cdots + u_n t^{m_n - m_1}}_{\in (t)}) t^{m_1}.
  \]
  So $u_1 + u_2 t^{m_2 - m_1} + \cdots + u_n t^{m_n - m_1}$ is a unit in $R$.

\item[(3)]
  By (1)(2),
  \[
    \mathrm{ord}(a_1 + \cdots + a_n) = \mathrm{ord}(a_1) < \infty,
  \]
  or $a_1 + \cdots + a_n \neq 0$
  (since $\mathrm{ord}$ is an order function on $K$).

  It suffices to show that $I^m + J^n = R$.

\item[(2)]
  Since $I^m + J^n \subseteq R$ is always true,
  it suffices to show that $I^m + J^n \supseteq R$.
  In fact,
  \begin{align*}
    R
    &= R^{m+n-1}
      &(1 \in R) \\
    &= (I+J)^{m+n-1}

    &= \sum_{i=0}^{m+n-1} I^i J^{m+n-1-i}
      &(\text{Problem 2.39}) \\
    &\subseteq I^m + J^n
  \end{align*}
  for all positive integers $m, n$.
  (If $m = 0$ or $n = 0$, then nothing to prove.)
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $I_i$ and $I_j$ are comaximal if $i \neq j$.}
  Note that
  \[
    R = I_i + J_i \subseteq I_i + I_j \subseteq R
  \]
  if $i \neq j$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{If $I_i$ is comaximal to $I_j$ and $I_{j'}$.
  Show that $I_i$ is also comaximal to $I_j I_{j'}$.}
  \begin{align*}
    R
    &= (I_i + I_j)(I_i + I_{j'}) \\
    &= I_i(I_i + I_j + I_{j'}) + I_j I_{j'}
      &(\text{Problem 2.39(a)}) \\
    &\subseteq I_i + I_j I_{j'} \subseteq R.
  \end{align*}

\item[(3)]
  By (2), it is easy to get that $I_i$ and $\prod_{j \neq i} I_j$
  are comaximal by induction on the number of $I_j$ for $j \neq i$.

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $I_1 \cdots I_N = I_1 \cap \cdots \cap I_N$.}
  Induction on $N$.
  \begin{align*}
    I_1 \cap \cdots \cap I_N
    &= I_1 \cap (I_2 \cap \cdots \cap I_N) \\
    &= I_1 \cap (I_2 \cdots I_N)
      &(\text{Induction hypothesis}) \\
    &= I_1 \cdot (I_2 \cdots I_N)
      &(\text{(3)}) \\
    &= I_1 \cdots I_N.
  \end{align*}

\item[(5)]
  Note that $I_i^n$ and $I_j^n$ are comaximal if $i \neq j$ by (a).
  We can apply the same argument in (2)(3)(4) to show that
  \[
    I_1^{n} \cdots I_N^{n} = I_1^{n} \cap \cdots \cap I_N^{n}.
  \]

\item[(6)]
  Therefore,
  \begin{align*}
    (I_1 \cap \cdots \cap I_N)^{n}
    &= (I_1 \cdots I_N)^{n}
      &((4)) \\
    &= I_1^{n} \cdots I_N^{n}
      &(\text{Problem 2.39(b)}) \\
    &= I_1^{n} \cap \cdots \cap I_N^{n}
      &((5)).
  \end{align*}

$\Box$\\\\

\emph{Let $I$, $J$ be ideals in $R$.
Suppose $I$ is finitely generated and $I \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(J)$.
Show that $I^n \subseteq J$ for some $n$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $I$ be generated by $x_1,\ldots,x_m \in I$.
  As $I \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(J)$, there are integers $n_i > 0$
  such that $x_i^{n_i} \in J$.

  Given any $x = \sum_{i=1}^{m} r_i x_i \in I$,
  so
  \begin{align*}
    x^N

  Note that for each term there is some $j$ such that $k_j \geq n_j$.

\emph{Suppose that $I$ is an ideal in a commutative ring.
Show that if $\mathrm{rad}(I)$ is finitely generated,
then for some integer $N$ we have $(\mathrm{rad}(I))^N \subseteq I$.
Conclude that in a Noetherian ring the ideals $I$ and $J$ have the same radical

Use the Nullstellensatz to deduce that if $I, J \subseteq S = k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
are ideals and $k$ is algebraically closed,
then $Z(I) = Z(J)$ iff $I^N \subseteq J$ and $J^N \subseteq I$ for some $N$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that if $\mathrm{rad}(I)$ is finitely generated,
  then for some integer $N$ we have $(\mathrm{rad}(I))^N \subseteq I$.}
  Say $x_1, \ldots, x_m \in \mathrm{rad}(I)$ generate $\mathrm{rad}(I)$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)]
    For each $i$, there exists an integer $n_i > 0$ such that $x_i^{n_i} \in I$
    (since $\mathrm{rad}(I)$ is radical).
    \item[(b)]
    Let $N = n_1 + \cdots + n_m$.
    Given any $x = \sum_{i=1}^{m} r_i x_i \in \mathrm{rad}(I)$,
    so
    \begin{align*}
      x^N
      &= \left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} r_i x_i \right)^{N} \\
      &= \sum_{k_1 + \cdots + k_m = N} {N \choose k_1,\ldots,k_m}
        r_1^{k_1} x_1^{k_1} \cdots r_m^{k_m} x_m^{k_m}.
    \end{align*}
    \item[(c)]
    Note that for each term there is some $j$ such that $k_j \geq n_j$.
    Hence,
    \begin{align*}
      & \: x_j^{k_j} = x_j^{k_j-n_j} x_j^{n_j} \in I
        &\text{($I$ is an ideal)} \\
      \Longrightarrow& \:

        &\text{($I$ is an ideal)} \\
      \Longrightarrow& \:
      x^N \in I.
        &\text{($I$ is an ideal)} \\
      \Longrightarrow& \:
        (\mathrm{rad}(I))^N \subseteq I.
    \end{align*}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that in a Noetherian ring the ideals $I$ and $J$ have the same radical
  iff there is some integer $N$ such that $I^N \subseteq J$ and $J^N \subseteq I$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)]
    $(\Longrightarrow)$
    Since in a Noetherian ring every ideal is finitely generated,
    $\mathrm{rad}(I)$ and $\mathrm{rad}(J)$ are finitely generated.
    By (1), there is a common integer $N$ such that
    \[
      (\mathrm{rad}(I))^N \subseteq I \:\: \text{ and } \:\:
      (\mathrm{rad}(J))^N \subseteq J.
    \]
    Note that $I^N \subseteq (\mathrm{rad}(I))^N$ and $J^N \subseteq (\mathrm{rad}(J))^N$.
    Since $\mathrm{rad}(I)$ = $\mathrm{rad}(J)$ by assumption,
    \begin{align*}
      I^N &\subseteq (\mathrm{rad}(I))^N = (\mathrm{rad}(J))^N \subseteq J, \\
      J^N &\subseteq (\mathrm{rad}(J))^N = (\mathrm{rad}(I))^N \subseteq I.
    \end{align*}
    \item[(b)]
    $(\Longleftarrow)$
    It suffices to show that $\mathrm{rad}(I) \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(J)$.
    $\mathrm{rad}(J) \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(I)$ is similar.
    Given any $x \in \mathrm{rad}(I)$, there is an integer $M > 0$ such that
    $x^M \in I$.
    Hence $x^{MN} \in I^N \subseteq J$, or $x \in \mathrm{rad}(J)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that if $I, J \subseteq S = k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
  are ideals and $k$ is algebraically closed,
  then $Z(I) = Z(J)$ iff $I^N \subseteq J$ and $J^N \subseteq I$ for some $N$.}
  Note that $S$ is Noetherian and we can apply part (2).

\emph{Suppose $R$ is a ring containing $k$, and $R$ is finite dimensional over $k$.
Show that $R$ is isomorphic to a direct product of local rings.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $\{ v_1, \ldots, v_n \}$ be a basis for $R$ over $k$ (as a vector space).
  Define a $k$-module homomorphism $\alpha: k[x_1,\ldots,x_n] \to R$
  by $\alpha(x_i) = v_i$.
  Clearly, $\alpha$ is surjective and thus
  \[
    R \cong k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/\ker(\alpha)
  \]
  as a $k$-module isomorphism.
  Note that $\ker(\alpha)$ is an ideal of $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.

\item[(2)]
  Write $I := \ker(\alpha)$.
  Hence,
  \[
    \dim_k(k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I) = \dim_k(R) < \infty.
  \]
  By Corollary 4 to the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz in \S 1.7,
  $V(I)$ is finite.

\item[(3)]
  Write $V(I) = \{ P_1, \ldots, P_N \}$ and $\mathcal{O}_i = \mathcal{O}_{P_i}(\mathbf{A}^n)$.
  By Proposition 6,
  \[
    R \cong k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I \cong \prod_{i=1}^{N} \mathcal{O}_i/I\mathcal{O}_i,
  \]
  which is isomorphic to a direct product of local rings.

Show that

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\ker(\varphi)$ is a subgroup of $M$.}
  It suffices to show that $a - b \in \ker(\varphi)$ for all $a, b \in \ker(\varphi)$.
  In fact, $\varphi(a - b) = \varphi(a) - \varphi(b) = 0 - 0 = 0$,
  or $a - b \in \ker(\varphi)$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $\ker(\varphi)$ is a submodule of $M$.}
  By (1), it suffices to show that $ra \in \ker(\varphi)$ for all $r \in R$ and $a \in \ker(\varphi)$.
  In fact, $\varphi(ra) = r \cdot \varphi(a) = r \cdot 0 = 0$,
  or $ra \in \ker(\varphi)$.

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathrm{im}(\varphi)$ is a subgroup of $M'$.}
  It suffices to show that $a - b \in \mathrm{im}(\varphi)$ for all $a, b \in \mathrm{im}(\varphi)$.
  As $a, b \in \mathrm{im}(\varphi)$,
  there are two elements $a', b' \in M$ such that $\varphi(a') = a$ and $\varphi(b') = b$.
  So $\varphi(a' - b') = \varphi(a') - \varphi(b') = a - b$,
  or $a - b \in \mathrm{im}(\varphi)$.

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathrm{im}(\varphi)$ is a submodule of $M$.}
  By (3), it suffices to show that $ra \in \mathrm{im}(\varphi)$
  for all $r \in R$ and $a \in \mathrm{im}(\varphi)$.
  As $a \in \mathrm{im}(\varphi)$,
  there is one element $a' \in M$ such that $\varphi(a') = a$.
  So $\varphi(ra') = r\varphi(a') = ra$,

  Note that $\ker(\varphi) \xrightarrow{i} M$ is the natural inclusion

Show that $\sum (-1)^i \dim(V_i) = 0$.} \\

\emph{Proof (Proposition 7 in \S 2.10).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  For $i = 0,\ldots,n$,
  by the rank-nullity theorem for a linear transformation
  $\varphi_{i}: V_{i} \to V_{i+1}$, we have
  \[
    \dim V_{i} = \dim \mathrm{im}(\varphi_{i}) + \dim \mathrm{ker}(\varphi_{i}).
  \]
  (Here $V_0 = V_{n+1} := 0$ by convention.)

\item[(2)]
  By the exactness of the sequence, we have
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    $\mathrm{im}(\varphi_{i}) = \mathrm{ker}(\varphi_{i+1})$ for $i = 0,\ldots, n-1$.
    In particular, $\mathrm{ker}(\varphi_{1}) = \mathrm{im}(\varphi_{0}) = 0$.

  \item[(b)]
    $\mathrm{ker}(\varphi_{n}) = V_n$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (-1)^i \dim(V_i)
    &= \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (-1)^i \dim \mathrm{im}(\varphi_{i})
