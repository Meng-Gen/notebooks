\subsubsection*{Problem 1.1.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.1.*}
\emph{Let $R$ be a domain.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{If $f$, $g$ are forms of degree $r$, $s$ respectively in $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$,
  show that $fg$ is a form of degree $r+s$.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that any factor of a form in $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is also a form. } \\
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    f &= \sum_{(i)} a_{(i)} x^{(i)}, \\
    g &= \sum_{(j)} b_{(j)} x^{(j)},
  \end{align*}
  where $\sum_{(i)}$ is the summation over $(i) = (i_1,\ldots,i_n)$ with $i_1+\cdots+i_n = r$
  and $\sum_{(j)}$ is the summation over $(j) = (j_1,\ldots,j_n)$ with $j_1+\cdots+j_n = s$.

\item[(2)]
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    fg
    &= \sum_{(i)} \sum_{(j)} a_{(i)}b_{(j)} x^{(i)}x^{(j)} \\
    &= \sum_{(i),(j)} a_{(i)}b_{(j)} x^{(k)}
  \end{align*}
  where $(k) = (i_1+j_1,\ldots,i_n+j_n)$ with $(i_1+j_1)+\cdots+(i_n+j_n) = r+s$.
  Each $x^{(k)}$ is the form of degree $r+s$ and $a_{(i)}b_{(j)} \in R$.
  Hence $fg$ is a form of degree $r+s$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Given any form $f \in R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, and write $f = gh$.
  \emph{It suffices to show that $g$ is a form as well.}
  (So does $h$.)

\item[(2)]
  Write
  \[
    g = g_0+\cdots+g_r,
    \qquad
    h = h_0+\cdots+h_s
  \]
  where $g_r \neq 0$ and $h_s \neq 0$.
  So
  \[
    f = gh = g_0h_0 + \cdots + g_r h_s.
  \]
  Since $R$ is a domain, $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is a domain and thus $g_r h_s \neq 0$.
  The maximality of $r$ and $s$ implies that $\deg f = r+s$.
  Therefore, by the maximality of $r+s$,
  $f = g_r h_s$, or $g = g_r$, or $g$ is a form.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.2.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.2.*}
\emph{Let $R$ be a UFD,
$K$ the quotient field of $R$.
Show that every element $z$ of $K$ may be written $z = a/b$,
where $a, b \in R$ have no common factors;
this representative is unique up to units of $R$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that every element $z$ of $K$ may be written $z=a/b$,
  where $a$, $b\in R$ have no common factors.}
  Given any $z = a/b \in K$ where $a, b\in R$.
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    a &= p_1 \cdots p_n, \\
    b &= q_1 \cdots q_m
  \end{align*}
  where all $p_1, \ldots, p_n, q_1, \ldots, q_m$ are irreducible in $R$.
  (It is possible since $R$ is a UFD.)
  For each $i$, suppose $p_i \mid q_j$ for some $i, j$.
  Write $q_j = p_i u$ for some $u \in R$.
  By the irreducibility of $p_i$ and $q_j$, $u$ is a unit.
  So
  \[
    z
    = \frac{a}{b}
    = \frac{p_1 \cdots \widehat{p_i} \cdots p_n}{q_1 \cdots \widehat{q_j} \cdots q_m}
    = \frac{p_1 \cdots \widehat{p_i} \cdots p_n}{u q_1 \cdots \widehat{q_j} \cdots q_m}.
  \]
  Continue this method we can write $z = \frac{a'}{b'}$ where $a'$ and $b'$ have no common factors.

\item[(2)]
  Write $z = a/b = a'/b'$ where
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    $a, b, a', b' \in R$,

  \item[(b)]
    $a$ and $b$ have no common factors,

  \item[(c)]
    $a'$ and $b'$ have no common factors.
  \end{enumerate}
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    a &= p_1 \cdots p_n, \\
    b &= q_1 \cdots q_m, \\
    a' &= p'_1 \cdots p'_{n'}, \\
    b' &= q'_1 \cdots q'_{m'}
  \end{align*}
  where all $p_i, q_j, p'_{i'}, q'_{j'}$ are irreducible in $R$.
  As $z = a/b = a'/b'$, $ab' = a'b$ or
  \[
    p_1 \cdots p_n q'_1 \cdots q'_{m'}
    = p'_1 \cdots p'_{n'} q_1 \cdots q_m.
  \]

\item[(3)]
  For $i = 1$, $p_1 = u_1 p'_{i'}$ for some unit $u_1 \in R$
  since $a$ and $b$ have no common factors and all $p_1, q_j, p'_{i'}$ are irreducible.
  Hence
  \[
    u_1 \widehat{p_1} p_2 \cdots p_n q'_1 \cdots q'_{m'}
    = p'_1 \cdots \widehat{p'_{i'}} \cdots p'_{n'} q_1 \cdots q_m.
  \]
  Continue this method,
  we have $n \leq n'$ and all $p_1, \ldots, p_n$ are canceled.

\item[(4)]
  Conversely, we can apply the argument in (3) to $i' = 1, \ldots n'$ to conclude that $n' \leq n$.
  Therefore, $n = n'$ and
  \[
    \underbrace{u_1 \cdots u_n}_{\text{a unit in $R$}} q'_1 \cdots q'_{m'} = q_1 \cdots q_m.
  \]
  Hence, $b = ub'$ where $u = u_1 \cdots u_n$ is a unit in $R$.
  Similarly, $a = va'$ where $v$ is a unit in $R$.
  So the representative of $z \in K$ is unique up to units of $R$.

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.3.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.3.*}
\emph{Let $R$ be a PID. Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a nonzero, proper, prime ideal in $R$.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathfrak{p}$ is generated by an irreducible element.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathfrak{p}$ is maximal.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $\mathfrak{p} = (a)$ be a nonzero, proper, prime ideal in $R$.
  It suffices to show that $a$ is irreducible.

\item[(2)]
  Suppose $a = bc$.
  By the primality of $\mathfrak{p}$, $b \in \mathfrak{p}$ or $c \in \mathfrak{p}$.
  Suppose $b \in \mathfrak{p} = (a)$. (The case $c \in \mathfrak{p}$ is similar.)
  Then there is a $d \in R$ such that $b = ad$.
  Hence, $a = bc = adc$ or $(1-dc)a = 0$.

\item[(3)]
  Since $R$ is a domain, $1 = dc$ or $a = 0$.
  $a = 0$ implies that $\mathfrak{p} = (0)$ is a zero ideal, contrary to the assumption.
  Therefore, $1 = dc$, or $c$ is a unit, or $a$ is irreducible.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Given any ideal $I = (b)$ of $R$ containing $\mathfrak{p} = (a)$.
  As the generator $a$ of $\mathfrak{p}$ is in $\mathfrak{p} \subseteq I$,
  there is some $c \in R$ such that $a = bc$.
  By the irreducibility of $a$ (in (a)), $b$ is a unit or $c$ is a unit.

\item[(2)]
  $b$ is a unit implies that $I = R$.
  $c$ is a unit implies that $I = \mathfrak{p}$.
  In any case, we conclude that $\mathfrak{p}$ is maximal.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.4.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.4.*}
\emph{Let $k$ be an infinite field,
$f \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.
Suppose $f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) = 0$ for all $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in k$.
Show that $f = 0$.
(Hint: Write
\[
  f = \sum f_i x_n^{i},
  \qquad
  f_i \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}].
\]
Use induction on $n$,
and the fact that $f(a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}, x_n)$
has only a finite number of roots if any $f_i(a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}) \neq 0$.)} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Induction on $n$.
  The case $n = 1$.
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  If there were a nonzero $f \in k[x_1]$ such that $f(a) = 0$ for all $a \in k$.
  Note that $f$ has at most $\deg f < \infty$ roots,
  contrary to the infinity of $k$.

\item[(2)]
  Assume that the conclusion holds for $n - 1$, then for any $f \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
  we can write
  \[
    f = \sum f_i x_n^{i},
    \qquad
    f_i \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}]
  \]
  as $f \in (k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}])[x_n]$.
  Suppose $f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) = 0$ for all $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in k$.
  For fixed $a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}$,
  the polynomial $f(a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}, x_n) \in k[x_n]$ has all distinct roots in
  an infinite field $k$.
  By (1), $f(a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}, x_n) = 0 \in k[x_n]$,
  or each $f_i(a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}) = 0$.
  As all $a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}$ run over $k$,
  we can apply the induction hypothesis
  each $f_i(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}) = 0 \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}]$.
  Hence, $f = 0 \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n}]$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Note.}
If $k$ is a finite field of order $q = p^k$,
then the polynomial $f(x) = x^q - x$ has $q$ distinct roots in $k$. \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.5.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.5.*}
\emph{Let $k$ be any field.
Show that there are an infinitely number of irreducible monic polynomials in $k[x]$.
(Hint: Suppose $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ were all of them, and factor $f_1\cdots f_n+1$ into irreducible factors.)} \\

\emph{Proof (Due to Euclid).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  If
  $f_1, \ldots, f_n$ were all irreducible monic polynomials, then
  we consider
  \[
    g = f_1 \cdots f_n + 1 \in k[x].
  \]
  So there is an irreducible monic polynomial $f = f_i$ dividing $g$ for some $i$
  since
  \[
    \deg g = \deg f_1 + \cdots + \deg f_n \geq 1
  \]
  and $k[x]$ is a UFD.

\item[(2)]
  However, $f$ would divide the difference
  \[
    g - f_1 \cdots f_{i-1} f_i f_{i+1} \cdots f_n = 1,
  \]
  contrary to $\deg f_i \geq 1$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.6.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.6.*}
\emph{Show that any algebraically closed field is infinite.
(Hint: The irreducible monic polynomials are $x - a$, $a \in k$.)} \\

\emph{Proof (Due to Euclid).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field.
  If $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ were all elements in $k$, then
  we consider a monic polynomials
  \[
    f(x) = (x - a_1) \cdots (x - a_n) + 1 \in k[x].
  \]

\item[(2)]
  Since $k$ is algebraically closed,
  there is an element $a \in k$ such that $f(a) = 0$.
  By assumption, $a = a_i$ for some $1 \leq i \leq n$,
  and thus $f(a) = f(a_i) = 1$, contrary to the fact that
  a field is a commutative ring where $0 \neq 1$ and all nonzero elements are invertible.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.7.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.7.*}
\emph{Let $k$ be a field, $f \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in k$.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that}
  \[
    f = \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n-a_n)^{i_n},
    \qquad
    \lambda_{(i)} \in k.
  \]

\item[(b)]
  \emph{If $f(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = 0$,
  show that $f = \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-a_i) g_i$ for some (not unique) $g_i$ in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Regard $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ as $(k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}])[x_n]$.
  Since $(k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}])[x_n]$ is a Euclidean domain with a function
  \[
    f \in (k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}])[x_n] \mapsto \deg_{x_n} f \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}
  \]
  satisfying the division-with-remainder property.

\item[(2)]
  Apply the division algorithm for $f$ and nonzero $x_n-a_n$
  to produce a quotient $q$ and remainder $r$ with
  $f = (x_n-a_n) q + r$ and either $r = 0$ or $\deg_{x_n}(r) < \deg_{x_n} (x_n-a_n) = 1$.
  That is, $r \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$ is a constant in $(k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}])[x_n]$.
  Continue this process to get that $f$ is of the form
  \[
    f = \sum_{i_n} f_{i_n} (x_n - a_n)^{i_n}
  \]
  where $f_{i_n} \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$.

\item[(3)]
  Use the same argument in (2) for each $f_{i_n} \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    f_{i_n}
    &= \sum_{i_{n-1}} \underbrace{f_{i_n,i_{n-1}}}_{\in k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-2}]}
      (x_{n-1} - a_{n-1})^{i_{n-1}} \\
    f_{i_n,i_{n-1}}
    &=
    \sum_{i_{n-2}} \underbrace{f_{i_n,i_{n-1},i_{n-2}}}_{\in k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-3}]}
      (x_{n-2} - a_{n-2})^{i_{n-2}}, \\
    & \cdots \\
    f_{i_n,\ldots,i_{2}}
    &= \sum_{i_1} \underbrace{f_{i_n,\ldots,i_1}}_{\in k} (x_1 - a_1)^{i_1}.
  \end{align*}
  Note that $f_{i_n,\ldots,i_1} \in k$, we can write
  \[
    f = \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n-a_n)^{i_n},
    \qquad
    \lambda_{(i)} \in k.
  \]
  by replacing all $f_{i_n,\ldots,i_k}$ by $f_{i_n,\ldots,i_{k-1}}$
  for $k = n, n-1, \ldots, 2$.

\item[(4)]
  Or use the induction on $n$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \[
    f = \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n-a_n)^{i_n},
    \qquad
    \lambda_{(i)} \in k
  \]
  by (a).

\item[(2)]
  As $f(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0$,
  $\lambda_{(i)} = 0$ if all $i_1, \ldots, i_n$ are zero, that it,
  there is no nonzero constant term in the representation of $f$.
  Hence, for each term
  \[
    f_{(i)} : = \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n-a_n)^{i_n}
  \]
  with $\lambda_{(i)} \neq 0$,
  there exists one $i_k > 0$ for some $1 \leq k \leq n$.
  So we can write
  \[
    f_{(i)}
    =
    (x_k-a_k)
      \underbrace{
        (\lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_k-a_k)^{i_k-1} \cdots (x_n-a_n)^{i_n})}_{
          := g_{(i)} \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]}.
  \]
  Note that the expression of $f_{(i)}$ is not unique since
  there may exist more than one $i_k > 0$ as $1 \leq k \leq n$.

\item[(3)]
  Now we iterate each nonzero term in $f$, apply the factorization in (2),
  and then group by each $x_k-a_k$.
  Therefore, we can write
  \[
    f = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-a_i)g_i
  \]
  for some $g_1 \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$.

\item[(4)]
  The expression of $f$ is not unique.
  For example, take $f(x,y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \in k[x,y]$.
  As $f(0,0) = 0$, we can write
  \begin{align*}
    f(x,y)
    &= x \cdot \underbrace{(x+2y)}_{g_1} + y \cdot \underbrace{y}_{g_2}, \text{ or } \\
    &= x \cdot \underbrace{(x+y)}_{g_1} + y \cdot \underbrace{(x+y)}_{g_2}, \text{ or } \\
    &= x \cdot \underbrace{x}_{g_1} + y \cdot \underbrace{(2x+y)}_{g_2}.
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.8.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.8.*}
\emph{Show that the algebraic subsets of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ are just the finite subsets, together
with $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ itself.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $k[x]$ is a PID if $k$ is a field.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    Let $I$ be an ideal of $k[x]$.

  \item[(b)]
    If $I = \{0\}$ then $I = (0)$ and $I$ is principal.

  \item[(c)]
    If $I \neq \{0\}$, then take $f$ to be a polynomial of minimal degree in $I$.
    It suffices to show that $I = (f)$.
    Clearly, $(f) \subseteq I$ since $I$ is an ideal.
    Conversely, for any $g \in I$,
    \[
      g(x) = f(x)h(x) + r(x)
    \]
    for some $h, r \in k[x]$ with $r = 0$ or $\deg r < \deg f$ (as $k[x]$ is a Euclidean domain).
    Now as
    \[
      r = g - fh \in I,
    \]
    $r = 0$ (otherwise contrary to the minimality of $f$),
    we have $g = fh \in (f)$ for all $g \in I$.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(2)]
  Let $Y$ be an algebraic subset of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$,
  say $Y = V(I)$ for some ideal $I$ of $k[x]$.
  Since $k[x]$ is a PID, $I = (f)$ for some $f \in k[x]$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    If $f = 0$, then $I = (0)$ and $Y = V(0) = \mathbf{A}^1(k)$.

  \item[(b)]
    If $f \neq 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ has finitely many roots in $k$,
    say $a_1, \ldots, a_m \in k$.
    Hence,
    \[
      Y = V(I) = V(f) = \{ f(a) = 0 : a \in k \}
      = \{ a_1, \ldots, a_m \}
    \]
    is a finite subsets of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  By (a)(b), the result is established.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Notes.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  By the Hilbert basis theorem, $k[x]$ is Noetherian as $k$ is Noetherian.
  Hence, for any algebraic subset $Y = V(I)$ of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$,
  we can write $I = (f_1, \cdots, f_m)$.
  Note that
  \[
    Y = V(I) = V(f_1) \cap \cdots \cap V(f_m).
  \]
  Now apply the same argument to get the same conclusion.

\item[(2)]
  Suppose $k = \overline{k}$.
  $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ is irreducible, because its only proper closed subsets are finite,
  yet it is infinite
  (because $k$ is algebraically closed, hence infinite). \\

\emph{If $k$ is a finite field, show that every subset of $\mathbf{A}^{n}(k)$ is algebraic.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Every subset of $\mathbf{A}^{n}(k)$ is finite since
  $|\mathbf{A}^{n}(k)| = |k|^n$ is finite.

\item[(2)]
  Note that $V(x_1-a_1,\ldots,x_n-a_n) = \{ (a_1,\ldots,a_n) \} \subseteq \mathbf{A}^{n}(k)$
  (Property (5) in \S 1.2)
  and any finite union of algebraic sets is algebraic (Property (4) in \S 1.2).
  Thus, every subset of $\mathbf{A}^{n}(k)$ is algebraic (by (1)).

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.10.}
\emph{Give an example of a countable collection of algebraic sets whose union is not
algebraic.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $k = \mathbb{Q}$ be an infinite field.
  $V(x-a) = \{ a \}$ is an algebraic sets for all $a \in \mathbb{Q}$.
  In particular, $V(x-a) = \{ a \}$ is algebraic for all $a \in \mathbb{Z}$.

\item[(2)]
  Note that
  \[
    Y := \bigcup_{a \in \mathbb{Z}} V(x-a) = \mathbb{Z}
  \]
  is a countable union of algebraic sets.
  Since $Y$ is a proper subset of $k = \mathbb{Q}$,
  it cannot be algebraic by Problem 1.8.

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.14.*}

\emph{Let $f$ be a nonconstant polynomial in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$,
$k$ algebraically closed.
Show that $\mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - V(f)$ is infinite if $n \geq 1$,
and $V(f)$ is infinite if $n \geq 2$.
Conclude that the complement of any proper algebraic set is infinite.
(Hint: See Problem 1.4.)} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - V(f)$ is infinite if $n \geq 1$.}
  Since $f$ is a nonconstant polynomial in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$,
  we may assume that $\deg_{x_n}(f) > 0$.
  Hence
  \[
    x_n \mapsto f(1,\ldots,1,x_n)
  \]
  is a nonconstant polynomial of degree $\deg_{x_n}(f) > 0$ in $k[x_n]$.
  So $f$ has finitely many roots in $k$, say $\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m$ ($m \geq 0$).
  Hence,
  \[
    (1,\ldots,1,x_n) \neq 0
  \]
  whenever $x_n \neq \xi_m$.
  Such subset in $\mathbf{A}^{1}(k)$ is infinite since $k = \overline{k}$ (Problem 1.6).
  Therefore,
  \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - V(f)
    &=
    \{ (a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) : f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \neq 0 \} \\
    &\supseteq
    \{ a_n  \in \mathbf{A}^{1}(k) : f(1,\ldots,1,x_n) \neq 0 \}
  \end{align*}
  is infinite.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $V(f)$ is infinite if $n \geq 2$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    Similar to (1).
    Since $f$ is a nonconstant polynomial in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$,
    we may assume that $m := \deg_{x_n}(f) > 0$.
    Write
    \[
      f = \sum_{i=0}^{m} f_i(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}) x_n^{i}.
    \]
    Note that each $f_i$ is well-defined since $n \geq 2$.

  \item[(b)]
    If $f_n$ is constant in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$,
    then $f_n$ is nonzero (since $m > 0$) or $V(f_n) = \varnothing$.
    If $f_n$ is nonconstant in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$,
    then the set $\mathbf{A}^{n-1}(k) - V(f_n)$ is infinite by (1).
    In any case,
    \[
      \mathbf{A}^{n-1}(k) - V(f_n)
    \]
    is infinite.

  \item[(c)]
    For each $P = (a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1}) \in \mathbf{A}^{n-1}(k) - V(f_n)$,
    \[
      g_P: x_n \mapsto f(P,x_n) = f(a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1},x_n)
    \]
    defines a polynomial in $k[x_n]$ of degree $m > 0$.
    Since $k = \overline{k}$, $g_P$ has at least one root $Q \in k$.
    Hence
    \[
      V(f) \supseteq
      \{ (P,Q) \in \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) : P \in \mathbf{A}^{n-1}(k) - V(f_n), g_P(Q) = 0 \}
    \]
    is infinite since the set $\mathbf{A}^{n-1}(k) - V(f_n)$ is infinite.
  \end{enumerate}
  \emph{Note.}
  It is not true if $k \neq \overline{k}$.
  For example, $V(x^2+y^2+1) = \varnothing$ in $\mathbf{A}^{2}(\mathbb{R})$.

\item[(3)]
  Note that
  \[
    \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - V(S)
    = \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - \bigcap_{f \in S} V(f)
    = \bigcup_{f \in S}( \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - V(f) ).
  \]
  Thus the complement of any proper algebraic set is infinite by (1).

It is called the \textbf{product} of $V$ and $W$.} \\

  \end{align*}
  where $S_V \subseteq k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ and $S_W \subseteq k[y_1,\ldots,y_m]$.
  It suffices to show that

  \]
  where
  $S \subseteq k[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m]$ is the union of $S_V$ and $S_W$.

\item[(2)]
  Here we can identify $S_V$ with the subset of
  $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m]$
  by noting that
  \[
    k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]
    \hookrightarrow (k[y_1,\ldots,y_m])[x_1,\ldots,x_n]
    = k[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m].
  \]
  Here we regard $k$ as a subring of $k[y_1,\ldots,y_m]$.
  Similar treatment to $S_W$.

\item[(3)]
  By construction, $V \times W \subseteq V(S)$.
  Conversely, given any $(P,Q) \in V(S) \subseteq \mathbf{A}^{n+m}(k)$,
  we have $h(P,Q) = 0$ for all $h \in S = S_V \cup S_W$ (by (2)).
  By construction, $f(P) = 0$ for all $f \in S_V$ since $f$ only involve $x_1,\ldots,x_n$.
  Hence, $P \in V$. Similarly, $Q \in W$. Therefore, $(P,Q) \in V \times W$.

  (Proof of Property (6) in \S 1.3.)
  \emph{Show that if $X \subseteq Y$, then $I(X) \supseteq I(Y)$.}
  If $f \in I(Y)$ then $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in Y$.

    so $P$ belongs to the zero set of $I(X)$.
  \end{enumerate}

  (Proof of Property (9) in \S 1.3.)
  \emph{$V(I(V(S))) = V(S)$ for any set $S$ of polynomials,

  So if $V$ is an algebraic set, $V = V(I(V))$,
  and if $I$ is the ideal of an algebraic set, $I = I(V(I))$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    In each case, it suffices to show that the left side is a subset of the right side.
    (by Properties (6)(8) in \S 1.3).

  \item[(b)]
    If $P \in V(S)$ then $f(P) = 0$ for all $f \in I(V(S))$, so $P \in V(I(V(S)))$.

  \item[(c)]
    If $f \in I(X)$ then $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in V(I(X))$.
    Thus $f$ vanishes on $V(I(X))$, so $f \in I(V(I(X)))$.

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $V = W$ if and only if $I(V) = I(W)$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    By Property (6) in \S 1.3, $I(V) \supseteq I(W)$ if $V \subseteq W$
    and $I(V) \subseteq I(W)$ if $V \supseteq W$.
    Thus, $I(V) = I(W)$ if $V = W$.

  \item[(b)]
    Conversely,
    $I(V) = I(W)$ implies that $V(I(V)) = V(I(W))$

    By Property (9) in \S 1.3, $V(I(V)) = V$ and $V(I(W)) = W$.

  \item[(d)]
    $(ra)^n = r^n a^n \in I$ if $a^n \in I$ and $r \in R$ (since $I$ is an ideal and $R$ is commutative).

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathrm{rad}(\mathrm{rad}(I)) = \mathrm{rad}(I)$.}
  It suffices to show $\mathrm{rad}(\mathrm{rad}(I)) \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(I)$.
  Given any $a \in \mathrm{rad}(\mathrm{rad}(I))$.
  By definition $a^n \in \mathrm{rad}(I)$ for some positive integer $n$.
  Again by definition $(a^n)^m = a^{nm} \in I$ for some positive integer $m$.
  As $nm$ is a postive integer, $a \in \mathrm{rad}(I)$.

  \emph{Show that every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ is radical.}
  Given any $a \in \mathrm{rad}(\mathfrak{p})$, that is,
  $a^n \in \mathfrak{p}$ for some positive integer.
  Write $a^n = a a^{n-1}$ if $n > 1$.
  By the primality of $\mathfrak{p}$, $a \in \mathfrak{p}$ or $a^{n-1} \in \mathfrak{p}$.
  If $a \in \mathfrak{p}$, we are done.
  If $a^{n-1} \in \mathfrak{p}$,
  we continue this descending argument (or the mathematical induction)
  until the power of $a$ is equal to $1$.
  Hence $\mathfrak{p}$ is radical.

\emph{Show that $I = (x^2+1) \subseteq \mathbb{R}[x]$ is a radical (even a prime) ideal,
but $I$ is not the ideal of any set in $\mathbf{A}^1(\mathbb{R})$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $I = (x^2+1)$ is a prime ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x]$.}
  Given any $fg \in I$.
  It suffices to show that $f \in I$ or $g \in I$.
  By definition of $I$,
  there is a polynomial $h \in \mathbb{R}[x]$ such that $fg = (x^2+1)h$.
  So $(x^2+1) \mid f$ or $(x^2+1) \mid g$
  since $x^2+1$ is irreducible in a unique factorization domain $\mathbb{R}[x]$.
  Therefore, $f \in I$ or $g \in I$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $I$ is not the ideal of any set in $\mathbf{A}^1(\mathbb{R})$.}
  Since $x^2+1$ has no roots in $\mathbb{R}$,
  $I$ cannot be the ideal of any nonempty set in $\mathbf{A}^1(\mathbb{R})$.

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $V(I) = V(\mathrm{rad}(I))$.}
  Since $I \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(I)$,
  it suffices to show that $V(I) \subseteq V(\mathrm{rad}(I))$.
  Given any $P \in V(I)$.
  For any $f \in \mathrm{rad}(I)$, $f^n \in I$ for some positive integer $n > 0$.
  Note that
  \[
    0 = (f^n)(P) = f(P)^n
  \]
  since $f^n \in I$ and $P \in V(I)$.
  As $k$ is a domain, $f(P)^n = 0$ implies $f(P) = 0$. So $P \in V(\mathrm{rad}(I))$.

  Note that $I(V(I))= I(\varnothing) = (1)$ and $\mathrm{rad}(I) = I = (x^2+1)$.

and that the natural homomorphism from $k$ to $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$ is an isomorphism.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $I$ is a maximal ideal.}
  Suppose that $J$ is an ideal such that $J \supsetneq I$.
  Take any $f \in J - I$.
  By Problem 1.7(a),
  \[
    f = \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n - a_n)^{i_n}.
  \]
  As $f \not\in I$, there is a nonzero constant term in $f$, say $\lambda \in k - \{0\}$.
  Note that $f - \lambda \in I \subsetneq J$.
  Hence,
  \[
    \lambda = f - (f - \lambda) \in J
  \]
  since $J$ is an ideal.
  As $\lambda \neq 0$, $J = k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is not a proper ideal containing $I$.

\item[(2)]
  Let $\varphi: k \to k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$ be the natural homomorphism.
  (That is, $\varphi: \lambda \to \lambda + I \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$.)

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $\varphi$ is surjective.}
  Given any $f + I \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$.
  By Problem 1.7(a),
  \[
    f = \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n - a_n)^{i_n}.
  \]
  So
  \begin{align*}
    f + I
    &= \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n - a_n)^{i_n} + I \\
    &= \left(f(a_1,\ldots,a_n)
      + \sum_{\text{nonconstant}} \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n - a_n)^{i_n} \right) + I \\
    &= f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) + I.
  \end{align*}
  (Here the summation over all nonconstant terms is in $I$.)
  Hence
  \[
    \varphi: f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in k \mapsto f + I.
  \]

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $\varphi$ is injective.}
  $\ker(\varphi) = \{ \lambda \in k : \lambda \in I \} = k \cap I = \{0\}$
  since $I$ is a proper ideal.

\item[(5)]
  By (2)(3)(4), $\varphi: k \to k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(x_1-a_1,\ldots,x_n-a_n)$
  is an isomorphism.

\emph{Let $I$ be an ideal in a ring $R$, $\pi: R \to R/I$ the natural homomorphism.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that for every ideal $J'$ of $R/I$,
  $\pi^{-1}(J') = J$ is an ideal of $R$ containing $I$,
  and for every ideal $J$ of $R$ containing $I$,
  $\pi(J) = J'$ is an ideal of $R/I$.
  This sets up a natural one-to-one correspondence between
  $\{ \text{ideals of $R/I$} \}$ and $\{ \text{ideals of $R$ that contain $I$} \}$.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that $J'$ is a radical ideal if and only if $J$ is radical.
  Similarly for prime and maximal ideals.}

  Conclude that $R/I$ is Noetherian if $R$ is Noetherian.
  Any ring of the form $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$ is Noetherian.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that for every ideal $J'$ of $R/I$,
  $\pi^{-1}(J') = J$ is an ideal of $R$ containing $I$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    \emph{Show that $J$ contains $I$.}
    Note that $\pi^{-1}(0) = I \subseteq \pi^{-1}(J') = J$.
    So $J$ contains $I$. In particular, $J \neq \varnothing$ since $I \neq \varnothing$.

  \item[(b)]
    \emph{Show that $J$ is a additive subgroup of $R$.}
    It suffices to show that
    $a - b \in J$
    for any $a \in J$ and $b \in J$.
    Actually,
    \[
      \pi(a - b) = \pi(a) - \pi(b) \in J'
    \]
    implies $a - b \in \pi^{-1}(J') = J$.

  \item[(c)]
    \emph{Show that for every $r \in R$ and every $a \in J$,
    the product $ra \in J$.}
    In fact,
    \[
      \pi(ra) = \pi(r) \pi(a) \in J'
    \]
    implies $ra \in \pi^{-1}(J') = J$.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that for every ideal $J$ of $R$ containing $I$,
  $\pi(J) = J'$ is an ideal of $R/I$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    \emph{Show that $J'$ is nonempty.}
    Note that $\pi(a) = 0 \in \pi(I) \subseteq \pi(J) = J'$ for any $a \in I$.
    So $J'$ is nonempty since $J$ is nonempty.

  \item[(b)]
    \emph{Show that $J'$ is a additive subgroup of $R/I$.}
    It suffices to show that
    $\pi(a) - \pi(b) \in J'$ for any $\pi(a) \in J'$, $\pi(b) \in J'$, $a \in J$ and $b \in J$.
    It is trivial since
    \[
      \pi(a) - \pi(b) = \pi(a - b) \in \pi(J) = J',
    \]
    $\pi$ is a ring homomorphism and $J$ is an ideal.

  \item[(c)]
    \emph{Show that for every $\pi(r) \in R/I$ ($r \in R$) and every $\pi(a) \in J'$ ($a \in J$),
    the product $\pi(r)\pi(a) \in J'$.}
    It is trivial since
    \[
      \pi(r)\pi(a) = \pi(ra) \in \pi(J) = J',
    \]
    $\pi$ is a ring homomorphism and $J$ is an ideal.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(3)]
  By (1)(2), we setup the correspondence between
  \[
    \{ \text{ideals of $R/I$} \}
    \longleftrightarrow
    \{ \text{ideals of $R$ that contain $I$} \}.
  \]
  Note that this correspondence preserves the subset relation,
  and thus this correspondence is one-to-one.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $J'$ is radical if $J$ is radical.}
  It suffices to show that $(a + I)^n = a^n + I \in J'$ implies that $a + I \in J'$.
  Note that
  \[
    (a + I)^n = a^n + I \in J'
  \]
  implies that $a^n \in J$ or $a \in J$ since $J$ is radical.
  Hence $a + I \in J/I = J'$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $J$ is radical if $J'$ is radical.}
  It suffices to show that $a^n \in J$ implies that $a \in J$.
  Note that
  \[
    \pi(a^n) = \pi(a)^n \in J'
  \]
  implies that $\pi(a) \in J'$ since $J'$ is radical.
  $a \in \pi^{-1}(J') = J$.

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $J'$ is prime if $J$ is prime.}
  It suffices to show that
  $(a + I)(b + I) = ab + I \in J'$ implies that $a + I \in J'$ or $b + I \in J'$.
  Note that
  \[
    (a + I)(b + I) = ab + I \in J'
  \]
  implies that $ab \in J$. So $a \in J$ or $b \in J$ by the primality of $J$.
  Hence $a + I \in J'$ or $b + I \in J'$.

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $J$ is prime if $J'$ is prime.}
  It suffices to show that $ab \in J$ implies that $a \in J$ or $b \in J$.
  Note that
  \[
    \pi(ab) = \pi(a)\pi(b) \in J'
  \]
  implies that $\pi(a) \in J'$ or $\pi(b) \in J'$ by the primality of $J'$.
  So $a \in \pi^{-1}(J') = J$ or $b \in \pi^{-1}(J') = J$.

\item[(5)]
  \emph{Show that $J'$ is maximal if $J$ is maximal.}
  Suppose $\mathfrak{m}$ is an ideal containing $J'$.
  By (a), $\pi^{-1}(\mathfrak{m})$ is an ideal containing $J$.
  So $\pi^{-1}(\mathfrak{m}) = J$ or $\pi^{-1}(\mathfrak{m}) = R$ by the maximality of $J$.
  Hence, $\mathfrak{m} = \pi(J) = J'$ or $\mathfrak{m} = \pi(R) = R/I$.

\item[(6)]
  \emph{Show that $J$ is maximal if $J'$ is maximal.}
  Suppose $\mathfrak{m}$ is an ideal containing $J$.
  By (a), $\pi(\mathfrak{m})$ is an ideal containing $J'$.
  So $\pi(\mathfrak{m}) = J'$ or $\pi(\mathfrak{m}) = R/I$ by the maximality of $J'$.
  Hence, $\mathfrak{m} = \pi^{-1}(J') = J$ or $\mathfrak{m} = \pi^{-1}(R/I) = R$.

\emph{Note.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Note that
  \[
    R/J \cong (R/I)/(J/I)
  \]
  if $J$ is an ideal of $R$ such that $I \subseteq J$.

\item[(2)]
  Hence, $J$ is prime iff $R/J \cong (R/I)/(J/I)$ is a domain iff $J/I$ is prime.

\item[(3)]
  Also, $J$ is maximal iff $R/J \cong (R/I)/(J/I)$ is a field iff $J/I$ is maximal. \\

\emph{Proof of (c).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $J'$ is finitely generated if $J$ is.}
  Suppose $J$ is generated by $a_1, \ldots, a_m$.
  It suffices to show that $J'$ is generated by
  \[
    a_1 + I, \ldots, a_m + I \in J/I.
  \]
  Given any $a + I \in J'$ where $a \in J$.
  Write $a = \sum_{1 \leq i \leq m} r_i a_i$ for some $r_i \in R$.
  Then
  \[
    a + I = \sum r_i a_i + I = \sum (r_i + I)(a_i + I)
  \]
  is generated by $a_1 + I, \ldots, a_m + I$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that that $R/I$ is Noetherian if $R$ is Noetherian.}
  Note that $R$ is an ideal of itself.

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that any ring of the form $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$ is Noetherian.}
  By the corollary to the Hilbert basis theorem,
  $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is Noetherian.
  By (2), the ring $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$ is Noetherian.

  Let $I = (y - x^2)$ be an ideal of $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$.
  Since $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed,

  It suffices to show that $I$ is prime,

  If we can show that $y$ is prime in $\mathbb{C}[y]$, then by the Eisenstein's criterion

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $f$ is an irreducible polynomial.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    Suppose
    \[
      f = (f_2(x) y^2 + f_1(x) y + f_0(x)) \cdot g(x)

    for some $f_i(x), g(x) \in \mathbb{R}[x]$.

      f_1(x)g(x) = 0,
      \qquad

\emph{Let $k = \mathbb{R}$.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that $I(V(x^2+y^2+1))=(1)$.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that every algebraic subset of $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$ is equal to $V(f)$
  for some $f \in \mathbb{R}[x,y]$.}
\end{enumerate}
\emph{This indicates why we usually require that $k$ be algebraically closed.} \\



\emph{Proof of (a).}
$I(V(x^2+y^2+1)) = I(\varnothing) = (1)$
since $x^2+y^2+1 \geq 1$ is never zero for any $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$.
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Given any algebraic subset $V$ of $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.
  $V = V(1)$ if $V = \varnothing$.
  $V = V(0)$ if $V = \mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.
  Now suppose $V$ is a nonempty proper algebraic subset $V$ of $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.
  Write $V = V_1 \cup \cdots \cup V_m$,
  where each $V_i$ is irreducible.
  Here $V_i \neq \varnothing$ and $V_i \neq \mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$ for all $i$.

\item[(2)]
  As $k = \mathbb{R}$ is infinite,
  Corollary 2 to Proposition 2 implies that each $V_i$ is either a point
  or an irreducible plane curves $V(f_i)$,
  where $f_i$ is an irreducible polynomial and $V(f_i)$ is infinite.

\item[(3)]
  If $V_i = \{ (a_i,b_i) \}$ is a point, then define
  \[
    f_i(x,y) = (x-a_i)^2 + (x-b_i)^2.
  \]
  By the property of $\mathbb{R}$, $V_i = V(f_i)$.

\item[(4)]
  Define $f = f_1 \cdots f_m \in \mathbb{R}[x,y]$.
  Hence,

    &= V(f_1) \cup \cdots \cup V(f_m) \\

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Note that
  \begin{align*}
    V(y^2-xy-x^2y+x^3)
    &= V((y-x^2)(y - x)) \\
    &= V(y-x^2) \cup V(y - x).

\item[(2)]
  Note that $y-x^2$ and $y-x$ are irreducible in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$
  and thus also in $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$
  by the similar argument in Problem 1.25(a).
  Also, $V(y-x^2)$ and $V(y - x)$ are infinite in $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$
  and thus also in $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$.

\item[(3)]
  Therefore,
  $V(y-x^2)$ and $V(y - x)$ are the irreducible components of $V(y^2-xy-x^2y+x^3)$
  in $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$ and also in $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  The elliptic curve $V(y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1))$ is irreducible over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.

\item[(2)]
  The elliptic curve $V(y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1))$ is irreducible over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$.

\item[(3)]
  The irreducible component of $V(x^3+x-x^2y-y)$ over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$ is $V(x - y)$.

\item[(4)]
  The irreducible components of $V(x^3+x-x^2y-y)$ over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$ are
  $V(x + i)$, $V(x - i)$ and $V(x - y)$. \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Similar to Problem 1.25.
  To show $y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1)$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$,
  we write
  \[
    y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1) \in (\mathbb{C}[x])[y].
  \]
  Note that $\mathbb{C}[x]$ is a UFD and $-x(x+1)(x-1)$ is the constant term.
  As $\mathbb{C}[x]/(x) \cong \mathbb{C}$ is a domain, $(x)$ is prime.
  Clearly, $x \mid x(x+1)(x-1)$ but $x^2 \nmid x(x+1)(x-1)$.
  By the Eisenstein's criterion,
  we can say $y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1)$ is irreducible over $(\mathbb{C}[x])[y]$.

\item[(2)]
  Moreover, $V(y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1))$ is infinite over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$
  and thus also over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$.
  ($y = f(x) = \sqrt{x(x+1)(x-1)}$ is continuous and strictly increasing on $[1,\infty)$
  in the sense of calculus.
  As the measure of $[1,\infty)$ is $\infty$, the set $V(y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1))$ is infinite
  over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.)

\item[(3)]
  By Corollary 1 to Proposition 2,
  $V(y^2 - x(x^2-1))$ itself is irreducible over $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$
  or $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$.

\item[(4)]
  Consider $V(x^3+x-x^2y-y) \subseteq \mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.
  \begin{align*}
    V(x^3+x-x^2y-y)
    &= V((x^2 + 1)(x - y)) \\
    &= V(x^2 + 1) \cup V(x - y) \\
    &= \varnothing \cup V(x - y) \\
    &= V(x - y).
  \end{align*}
  Here we use that fact that
  $x^2 + 1 = 0$ has no real solution $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
  Similar to (a), $V(x - y)$ is the only irreducible component of $V(x^3+x-x^2y-y)$
  in $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.

\item[(5)]
  Consider $V(x^3+x-x^2y-y) \subseteq \mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$.
  \begin{align*}
    V(x^3+x-x^2y-y)
    &= V((x + i)(x - i)(x - y)) \\
    &= V(x + i) \cup V(x - i) \cup V(x - y).
  \end{align*}
  Similar to (a), $V(x \pm i)$ and $V(x - y)$ are the irreducible components of $V(x^3+x-x^2y-y)$
  in $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{C})$.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.32.}
\emph{Show that both theorems and all of the corollaries are false
if $k$ is not algebraically closed.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Weak Nullstellensatz:
  $I = (x^2+1)$ is a proper ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ but $V(I) = \varnothing$.

\item[(2)]
  Hilbert's Nullstellensatz:
  Let $I = (y^2 + x^2(x-1)^2)$ be an ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$.
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    I(V(I))
    &= I(\{ (0,0), (1,0) \})
      &(\text{Problem 1.26.}) \\
    &= (x(x-1),y) \\
    &\neq I \\
    &= \mathrm{rad}(I).
  \end{align*}
  The last equality holds since $f$ is irreducible in a UFD $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$
  and thus $I$ is a prime ideal.

\item[(3)]
  Corollary 1: Same example in the case Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.
  If $I = (y^2 + x^2(x-1)^2)$ is a radical ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$.
  Then $I(V(I)) \neq I$.

\item[(4)]
  Corollary 2: Same example in the case Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.
  If $I = (y^2 + x^2(x-1)^2)$ is a prime ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$,
  then
  \[
    V(I) = \{ (0,0), (1,0) \} = V(x,y) \cup V(x-1,y)
  \]
  is reducible.
  Next, consider a prime ideal $J = (x^2+y^2)$ in $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$.
  (Use the same argument in Problem 1.26 to get the irreducibility of $x^2+y^2$.)
  $V(J) = \{ (0,0) \}$ is a point but $J$ is not a maximal ideal
  (since $J \subsetneq (x^2+y^2,x) \subsetneq (1)$).

\item[(5)]
  Corollary 3: Same example in Corollary 2.

\item[(6)]
  Corollary 4:
  Let $I = (x^2 + y^2)$ be an ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$.
  Then $V(I) = \{ (0,0) \}$ is a finite set.
  But $\mathbb{R}[x,y]/(x^2 + y^2)$ is an infinite dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{R}$.
  In fact, the monomials
  \[
    \{ \overline{x^m}, \overline{x^m y} : m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \}
  \]
  is a basis for $\mathbb{R}[x,y]/(x^2 + y^2)$.

  \end{align*}
  By the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz,

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $I = (x^2+y^2-1, y + iz)$ is prime in $\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]$.}
  Note that

  So it suffices to show that
  \[
    x^2+y^2-1 \in \mathbb{C}[x,y]

  is irreducible.
  (Thus, $\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(x^2+y^2-1) \cong \mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/I$ is a domain, or $I$ is prime.)
  We can use the similar argument in Problem 1.31 (b) to show
  $x^2+y^2-1 = y^2 + (x+1)(x-1)$ is irreducible
  as showing the irreducibility of $y^2 - x(x+1)(x-1)$.

\item[(3)]
  Similarly, $I = (x^2+y^2-1, y - iz)$ is prime.
  Therefore,
  the irreducible components of $V(x^2+y^2-1, x^2-z^2-1)$

  It is equivalent to show that

\item[(2)]
  Suppose $f$ is reducible of degree $2$ or $3$.
  Then there exist nonconstant monic polynomials $g, h \in R[x]$ such that $f = gh$.
  By
  \[
    \deg(g) + \deg(h) = \deg(f) = 2 \text{ or } 3,
  \]
  we may assume that $\deg(g) = 1$. (Otherwise $g$ or $h$ will be a constant polynomial.)
  Say $g(x) = x - a$ where $a \in R$.
  Now
  \[
    f(a) = g(a)h(a) = 0

  implies that $a \in R$ is a root of $f$.

\item[(3)]
  Conversely, if $a \in R$ is a root of $f$, then
  apply the same argument in Problem 1.7 we can write
  \[
    f = (x - a)g

  for some $g \in R[x]$.
  Here $\deg(g) \geq 1$ since $\deg(f) = 1 + \deg(g) \geq 2$.
  Therefore, $f$ is reducible.

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Clearly, $V(I) = \{ (0,0) \}$ is a finite set.
  By Corollary 4 to the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz,
  \[
    \dim_{\mathbb{C}}(\mathbb{C}[x,y]/I) < \infty.

  In fact, $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}(\mathbb{C}[x,y]/I) = 4$.

\item[(2)]
  Given any $f + I \in \mathbb{C}[x,y]/I$ where $f \in \mathbb{C}[x,y]$.
  Write
  \[
    f(x,y) = \sum_{i} f_i(x) y^i

    y^2 &= \frac{1}{2}(y^2+x^2) + \frac{1}{2}(y^2-x^2) \in I.

  So
  \begin{align*}
    f(x,y) + I
    &= \sum_{i} f_i(x) y^i + I \\
    &= f_0(x) + f_1(x) y + I \\

  \[
    g = fq + r

  We can regard any linear combination of $\{ 1, x, \ldots, x^{n-1} \}$

  $r \in (f)$ implies that there exists a polynomial $g \in K[x]$

  If $g \neq 0$, then $\deg(r) = \deg(f) + \deg(g) \geq n$, which is impossible.
  So $g = 0$ and thus $r = fg = 0 \in K[x]$.

  \emph{Let $R$ be a UFD, and let $\mathfrak{p} = (t)$ be a principal proper prime ideal.
  Show that there is no prime ideal $\mathfrak{q}$
  such that $0 \subsetneq \mathfrak{q} \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}$.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Let $V = V(f)$ be irreducible hypersurface in $\mathbf{A}^n$.
  Show that there is no irreducible algebraic set $W$ such that
  $V \subsetneq W \subsetneq \mathbf{A}^n$.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  Suppose that $\mathfrak{q}$ were a prime ideal in $R$ such that
  $0 \subsetneq \mathfrak{q} \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that there is an irreducible element in $\mathfrak{q}$.}
  Given any $q \in \mathfrak{q}$. Since $\mathfrak{q}$ is proper,
  we can write
  \[
    q = q_1 \cdots q_n
  \]
  as a product of irreducible elements in a UFD.
  Since $\mathfrak{q}$ is prime, there is one irreducible element $q_i \in \mathfrak{q}$.

\item[(3)]
  Now $q_i \in \mathfrak{q} \subseteq \mathfrak{p} = (t)$.
  So $q_i = ut$ for some $u \in R$.
  By the irreducibility of $q_i$, $u$ is a unit or $t$ is a unit.
  If $u$ is a unit, then
  \[
    (t) = (q_i) \subseteq \mathfrak{q} \subseteq \mathfrak{p} = (t).
  \]
  So $\mathfrak{q} = \mathfrak{p}$, which is absurd.
  If $t$ is a unit, then $\mathfrak{p} = (1)$, contrary to the primality of $\mathfrak{p}$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  We might assume that $k = \overline{k}$.
  By Corollary 3 to the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and the irreducibility of $V(f)$,
  there are an irreducible polynomial $g \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ and an integer $m > 0$
  such that
  \[
    f = g^m,
  \]
  and
  \[
    I(V(f)) = (g).
  \]

\item[(2)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  Suppose that there were an irreducible algebraic set $W$ such that
  $V \subsetneq W \subsetneq \mathbf{A}^n$.
  Then by Corollary 3 to the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz again,
  \[
    (g) = I(V(f)) \supsetneq I(W) \supsetneq (1) \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n].
  \]
  Here $(g) = I(V(f))$ and $I(W)$ are all prime.

\item[(3)]
  Note that $(g)$ is a principal proper prime ideal in a UFD $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.
  By (a), such ideal $I(W)$ cannot be prime, which is absurd.

  $r = x r_1 + r_0$ for some $r_1, r_0 \in k[y,z]$.

$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
  As $0 = \alpha(f) = a + ct^6 + bt^9 + dt^{15} \in k[t]$,
  $a = b = c = d = 0 \in k$.

\emph{Proof of (c).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $I \subseteq \ker(\alpha)$ is trivial.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $\ker(\alpha) \subseteq I$.}
  Take any $f \in \ker(\alpha)$, or $\alpha(f) = 0$.
  By (a), $f = r + f_1$ where $f_1 \in I$ and $r = a + bx + cy + dxy \in k[x,y,z]$
  for some $a, b, c, d \in k[z]$.
  Note that $\alpha$ is a ring homomorphism.
  Therefore,
  \[
    0 = \alpha(f) = \alpha(r + f_1) = \alpha(r) + \alpha(g) = \alpha(r).
  \]
  By (b), $r = 0 \in k[x,y,z]$ and thus $f = f_1 \in I$.

\item[(3)]
  Therefore,
  \[
    \alpha: k[x,y,z]/(x^2-y^3, y^2-z^3) \hookrightarrow k[t]

  is injective.

  Note that $\deg f \geq 1$.

\item[(2)]
  Since $k$ is algebraically closed,
  every polynomial is a product of first degree polynomials, say
  \[
    f(x) = c(x - \alpha_1) \cdots (x - \alpha_m)
  \]
  where $c \in k-\{0\}$ and $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_m \in k$.
  As $f(\alpha) = 0$, $\alpha = \alpha_i \in k$ for some $1 \leq i \leq m$.
  Hence, $\alpha \in L$ is algebraic over $k$ implies that $\alpha \in k$.

\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Suppose that $L$ is module-finite field extensions of
  an algebraically closed field $k$.

\item[(2)]
  By Problem 1.41, $L$ is ring-finite over $k$.
  By Problem 1.47, $L$ is integral or algebraic over $k$ (since $k$ is a field).

  \emph{Show that any element of $L$ that is integral over $K[x]$ is already in $K[x]$.
  (Hint: If $z^n + a_1 z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n = 0$, write $z = f/g$,
  $f, g$ relatively prime. Then $f^n + a_1 f^{n-1}g + \cdots + a_n g^n = 0$,
  So $g$ divides $f$.)}

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Note that $0$ is integral over $K[x]$ and $0 \in K[x]$ trivially.

\item[(2)]
  Now we take any nonzero element $z \in L = K(x)$ which is integral over $K[x]$.
  So $z^n + a_1 z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n = 0$ for some $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in K[x]$
  and $a_n \neq 0$ (since $z \neq 0$).

\item[(3)]
  Write $z = f/g$, $f, g$ relatively prime in $K[x]$.
  Then
  \[
    f^n + a_1 f^{n-1}g + \cdots + a_n g^n = 0 \in K[x].
  \]
  Since $a_n \neq 0$, $g \mid f^n$ or $g \mid f$ or $g = 1 \in K$.
  Therefore, $z = f \in K[x]$.

\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  Suppose there were a nonzero element $f \in K[x]$ such that for

\item[(2)]
  Let $z = 1/g \in K(x)$, where $g$ is an irreducible polynomial not dividing $f$.
  The existence of $g$ is guaranteed by Problem 1.5.

\item[(3)]
  By the hypothesis in (1), there is an integer $n > 0$ such that
  $f^n z$ is integral over $K[x]$.
  By (a), $f^n z = f^n/g$ is also in $K[x]$. So $g \mid f^n$ or $g \mid f$,

  Let $R$ be the set of elements of $L$ that are algebraic over $K$.

  Here $v^{-1} = \left(- \frac{1}{a_n} v^{n-1} - \cdots - \frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} \right)$

  $(f)$ is a prime ideal in a UFD $K[x]$ since $f$ is irreducible.

  $\mathrm{im}(\alpha) = K(y)$ clearly.

  Note that $\mathrm{ker}(\alpha)$ is an ideal containing $(f)$ since $\alpha(f) = 0$.
  $\mathrm{ker}(\alpha)$ is proper since $\alpha(1) = 1 \neq 0$.

  Let $p(x) \in K[x]$ be an irreducible factor of $f(x) \in K[x]$,

  Then we might regard $K$ as a subfield of $L'$
  by sending $a \in K$ to $\overline{a} = a + (p(x)) \in L'$.

\item[(3)]
  By Problem 1.51(a), $\overline{x}$ is a root of $p \in L'$;
  therefore is a root of $f$.

\item[(4)]
  Induction on $n$. By (1)(2)(3), there is a field $L' \supseteq K$

Let $L$ be a splitting field of $f$,

Show that the $x_i$ are distinct.

if $(x - \overline{x})^2$ divides $f$, then $g(\overline{x}) = 0$.)} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Since $f \in K[x]$ is irreducible over $K$,
  $\gcd(f, f_x)$ is $1$ or $f$.
  As $\mathrm{char}(K) = 0$, $\deg(f_x) = \deg(f) - 1$.
  So $f$ does not divide $f_x$ or $\gcd(f, f_x) = 1$.
  Hence, there are polynomials $g, h \in K[x]$ such that
  \[
    1 = f g + f_x h.
  \]
  This equation is also true in $L[x]$.

\item[(2)]
  Note that
  \begin{align*}

  If $\overline{x}$ were a multiple root of $f$,

  By (1),
  \[

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Take any $v \in L$, which is algebraic over $K$.
  Write
  \[
    v^n + a_1 v^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n = 0
  \]
  for some $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in K$ and $a_n \neq 0$.
  Since $K$ is the quotient field of $R$,
  there is a common denominator $a \in R$ of $a_1, \ldots, a_n$.
  Here $a \neq 0$ and $aa_i \in R$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$.

  \end{align*}
  $av$ is integral over $R$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Since $L$ be a finite algebraic extension of $K$,
  there exists a basis

    \{ w_1, \ldots, w_n \}

  for $L$ over $K$ (as a vector space).

\item[(2)]
  For each $w_i \in L$, there is a nonzero $a_i \in R$ such that
  $a_i w_i$ is integral over $R$ (by (a)).
  So it suffices to show that
  \[
    \{ a_1 w_1, \ldots, a_n w_n \}

  Suppose

  for some $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in K$.
  Since $\{ w_1, \ldots, w_n \}$ is a basis,
  $\alpha_i a_i = 0$ for all $i$, or $\alpha_i = 0$ for all $i$ (since all $a_i \neq 0$).
  Hence $\{ a_1 w_1, \ldots, a_n w_n \}$ is linearly independent.

\item[(4)]
  Also,
  for any $w \in L$, we can write
  \begin{align*}
    w

  Hence $k[x]$ may be regarded as a subring of $\Gamma(V)$,
  and thus the multiplication in $\Gamma(V)$
  makes $\Gamma(V)$ a $k[x]$-module.

\item[(3)]
  Given any $g(x,y) + (f(x,y)) \in k[x,y]/(f)$ where $g \in k[x,y] = (k[x])[y]$.
  By the division-with-remainder property of $(k[x])[y]$,
  \[
    g = fq + r
  \]
  for some $q, r \in (k[x])[y]$ and
  \[
    r = r_1(x) y^{n-1} + \cdots + r_n(x)
  \]
  where $r_1, \ldots, r_n \in k[x]$.
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    g + (f)
    &= fq + r + (f) \\
    &= r + (f) \\
    &= r_1(x) y^{n-1} + \cdots + r_n(x) + (f) \\
    &= \underbrace{r_1(x)}_{\in k[x]} \overline{y}^{n-1} + \cdots
      + \underbrace{r_n(x)}_{\in k[x]} \overline{1},
  \end{align*}
  which means that
  the residues $\overline{1}, \overline{y}, \ldots, \overline{y}^{n-1}$
   generate $\Gamma(V)$ over $k[x]$ as a module.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 2.6.*}
\emph{Let $\varphi: V \to W$, $\psi: W \to Z$.
Show that $\widetilde{\psi \circ \varphi} = \widetilde{\varphi} \circ \widetilde{\psi}$.
Show that the composition of polynomial maps is a polynomial map.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\widetilde{\psi \circ \varphi} = \widetilde{\varphi} \circ \widetilde{\psi}$.}
  It is equivalent to show that
  \[
    (\widetilde{\psi \circ \varphi})(f) = (\widetilde{\varphi} \circ \widetilde{\psi})(f)
  \]
  for all $f \in \mathscr{F}(Z,k)$.
  In fact,
  \begin{align*}
    (\widetilde{\psi \circ \varphi})(f)
    &= f \circ \psi \circ \varphi, \\
    (\widetilde{\varphi} \circ \widetilde{\psi})(f)
    &= \widetilde{\varphi} ( \widetilde{\psi}(f) )
    = \widetilde{\varphi} ( f \circ \psi )
    = f \circ \psi \circ \varphi.
  \end{align*}

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that the composition of polynomial maps is a polynomial map.}
  Say $V \subseteq \mathbf{A}^n, W \subseteq \mathbf{A}^m, Z \subseteq \mathbf{A}^r$.
  Since $\varphi$ (resp. $\psi$) is a polynomial map,
  there are polynomials $t_1,\ldots,t_m \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
  (resp. $s_1,\ldots,s_r \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_m]$)
  such that
  \begin{align*}
    \varphi(P)
    &= (t_1(P),\ldots,t_m(P)) \\
    \psi(Q)
    &= (s_1(Q),\ldots,s_r(Q))
  \end{align*}
  for all $P \in V$ (resp. $Q \in W$).
  Hence the composition $\psi \circ \varphi$ is
  \begin{align*}
    (\psi \circ \varphi)(P)
    =& \: \psi(\varphi(P)) \\
    =& \: \psi(t_1(P),\ldots,t_m(P)) \\
    =& \: (s_1(t_1(P),\ldots,t_m(P)), \ldots, s_r(t_1(P),\ldots,t_m(P))).
  \end{align*}
  So there are polynomials $y_1,\ldots,y_r \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
  defined by
  \[
    y_i(P) = s_i(t_1(P),\ldots,t_m(P))
  \]
  for all $(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in \mathbf{A}^n$
  such that
  \[
    (\psi \circ \varphi)(P)
    = (y_1(P),\ldots,y_r(P)).
  \]
  (Note that the composition of polynomials is a polynomials.)
  Hence $\psi \circ \varphi$ is a polynomial map.

\emph{If $\varphi: V \to W$ is a polynomial map,

show that $\varphi^{-1}(X)$ is an algebraic subset of $V$.
If $\varphi^{-1}(X)$ is irreducible,
and $X$ is contained in the image of $\varphi$, show that $X$ is irreducible.
This gives a useful test for irreducibility.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\varphi^{-1}(X) = V(\widetilde{\varphi}(I(X)))$ is algebraic.}
  \begin{align*}
    P \in \varphi^{-1}(X)
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    \varphi(P) \in X \\
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    f(\varphi(P)) = 0 \: \forall f \in I(X) \\
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    \widetilde{\varphi}(f)(P) = 0 \: \forall f \in I(X) \\
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    g(P) = 0 \: \forall g \in \widetilde{\varphi}(I(X)) \\
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    P \in V(\widetilde{\varphi}(I(X))).
  \end{align*}
  Also note that $\widetilde{\varphi}(I(X))$ is an ideal in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
  since $\varphi$ is a polynomial map.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{If $\varphi^{-1}(X)$ is irreducible,
  and $X$ is contained in the image of $\varphi$, show that $X$ is irreducible.}
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  Suppose that $X$ were reducible or $I(X)$ were not prime.
  So that there exist two polynomials $f_1, f_2 \not\in I(X)$ but $f_1 f_2 \in I(X)$.
  By definition of $I(X)$, there exist two points $P_1, P_2 \in X$
  such that $f_i(P_i) \neq 0$ for $i = 1, 2$.

\item[(3)]
  Since $X$ is contained in the image of $\varphi$,
  there are two corresponding points $Q_1, Q_2 \in \varphi^{-1}(X)$ such that
  $\varphi(Q_i) = P_i$.
  So $\widetilde{\varphi}(f_i)(Q_i) = f_i(P_i) \neq 0$,
  or $\widetilde{\varphi}(f_i) \not\in I(\varphi^{-1}(X))$.
  However
  \[
    \widetilde{\varphi}(f_1)\widetilde{\varphi}(f_2)
    = \widetilde{\varphi}(f_1 f_2)
    \in I(\varphi^{-1}(X))
  \]
  since $f_1 f_2 \in I(X)$,
  contrary to the primality of $I(\varphi^{-1}(X))$.

\subsubsection*{Problem 2.8.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that $\{ (t,t^2,t^3) \in \mathbf{A}^3(k) : t \in k \}$ is an affine variety.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that $V(xz-y^2, yz - x^3, z^2-x^2y) \subseteq \mathbf{A}^3(\mathbb{C})$ is a variety.
  (Hint: $y^3-x^4$, $z^3-x^5$, $z^4-y^5 \in I(V)$.
  Find a polynomial map from $\mathbf{A}^1(\mathbb{C})$ onto $V$.)} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $Y := \{ (t,t^2,t^3) \in \mathbf{A}^3(k) : t \in k \}$ be the twisted cubic curve.
  By Problem 2.7, it suffices to show that
  there is a polynomial map from $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ onto $Y$.
  Here we use the fact that $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ is irreducible as $k = \overline{k}$ is infinite
  (by Problem 1.29).

\item[(2)]
  Define a mapping $\varphi$ from $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ to $Y$ by
  $\varphi(t) = (t,t^2,t^3) \in Y$.
  $\varphi$ is a polynomial map. Also, $\varphi$ is surjective.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Note.}
  Also see Problems 1.11 and 1.33 (for the case $k = \mathbb{C}$). \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  We prove for any algebraically closed field $k$.

\item[(2)]
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    V &= V(xz-y^2, yz - x^3, z^2-x^2y), \\
    Y &= \{ (t^3,t^4,t^5) \in \mathbf{A}^3(k) : t \in k \}.
  \end{align*}
  We want to show that $Y = V$. $Y \subseteq V$ is trivial.
  Now given any $(x,y,z) \in V$.
  If $x = 0$, then $y = z = 0$. So $(x,y,z) = (0,0,0) \in Y$.
  If $x \neq 0$, define
  \[
    t = \frac{y}{x} \in k.
  \]
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    t^3 &= \frac{y^3}{x^3} = \frac{y(xz)}{x^3} = \frac{yz}{x^2} = \frac{x^3}{x^2} = x, \\
    t^4 &= tx = y, \\
    t^5 &= ty = \frac{y^2}{x} = \frac{xz}{x} = z.
  \end{align*}

\item[(3)]
  Same as (a).
  Define a mapping $\varphi$ from $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ to $Y = V$
  by $\varphi(t) = (t^3,t^4,t^5) \in Y = V$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Note.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  We don't use the hint.

\item[(2)]
  In fact, it is easy to show that
  \[
    Y = V(y^3-x^4, z^3-x^5, z^4-y^5).
  \]

\item[(3)]
  $I(V)$ is a prime ideal of height $2$ in $k[x,y,z]$
  which cannot be generated by $2$ elements.
  We say $V$ is \textbf{not a local complete intersection}. \\\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that $\widetilde{\varphi} (I_W(W')) \subseteq I_V(V')$ (see Problems 2.3).}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that the restriction of $\varphi$ gives a polynomial map from $V'$ to $W'$.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  It suffices to show that $f \in I_V(V')$
  for any $f = \widetilde{\varphi}(g) \in \widetilde{\varphi} (I_W(W'))$
  for some $g \in I_W(W')$.

\item[(2)]
  To show $f \in I_V(V')$, it suffices to show that $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in \varphi(V')$.
  In fact,
  \[
    f(P) = \widetilde{\varphi}(g)(P) = g(\varphi(P)) = 0
  \]
  since $\varphi(V') \subseteq W'$ and $g \in I_W(W')$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Similar to Problem 2.3.

  such that
  \[
    \varphi(P) = (t_1(P),\ldots,t_m(P)) \in W
  \]
  for all $P \in V$.
  So that $\varphi|_{V'}: V' \to \varphi(V') \subseteq W'$ is also a polynomial map
  which is equipped with the same polynomials $t_1,\ldots,t_m$
  such that
  \[
    \varphi(P) = (t_1(P),\ldots,t_m(P)) \in W' \subseteq W

Define

  G(f) &= \{ (a_1,\ldots,a_n,a_{n+1}) \in \mathbf{A}^{n+1} \\
  &\qquad : (a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in V \text{ and } a_{n+1} = f (a_1,\ldots,a_n) \},

Show that $G(f)$ is an affine variety,
and that the map $(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \mapsto (a_1,\ldots,a_n,f(a_1,\ldots,a_n))$
defines an isomorphism of $V$ with $G(f)$. (Projection gives the inverse.)} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Define $I = I(V)$ as an ideal in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.
  Note that
  \[
    G(f) = V\underbrace{(I, x_{n+1} - f)}_{:= J}.
  \]
  Here we can view $I$ as an ideal of $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n,x_{n+1}]$.

\item[(2)]
  To show that $G(f)$ is an affine variety, it suffices to show that
  \[
    I(G(f)) = I(V(J)) = \mathrm{rad}(J)
  \]
  is prime (by Proposition 1 in \S 1.5 and the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz in \S 1.7).
  Suppose $gh \in I(G(f)) = \mathrm{rad}(J)$. Write
  \begin{align*}
    g
    &= \sum_{i} g_i x_{n+1}^i
    = \sum_{i} g_i (\underbrace{(x_{n+1} - f)}_{\in J} + f)^i, \\
    h
    &= \sum_{j} h_j x_{n+1}^j
    = \sum_{j} h_j (\underbrace{(x_{n+1} - f)}_{\in J} + f)^j
  \end{align*}
  where $g_i, h_j \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.

\item[(3)]
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    \mathrm{rad}(J)
    &= gh + \mathrm{rad}(J)
      &(gh \in \mathrm{rad}(J)) \\
    &= (g + \mathrm{rad}(J))(h + \mathrm{rad}(J)) \\
    &= \left( \sum_{i} g_i f^i + \mathrm{rad}(J) \right)
      \left( \sum_{j} h_j f^j + \mathrm{rad}(J) \right)
      &(x_{n+1} - f \in J) \\
    &= \left( \sum_{i} g_i f^i \right)
      \left( \sum_{j} h_j f^j \right) + \mathrm{rad}(J)
  \end{align*}
  or
  \[
    \underbrace{\left( \sum_{i} g_i f^i \right)^N
      \left( \sum_{j} h_j f^j \right)^N}_{\in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]}
    \in J = (I, x_{n+1} - f)
  \]
  for some positive integer $N$.
  So that $\left( \sum_{i} g_i f^i \right)^N \left( \sum_{j} h_j f^j \right)^N \in I$.

\item[(4)]
  Since $I = I(V)$ is a prime ideal,
  we might get $\sum_{i} g_i f^i \in I \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(J)$.
  (The case $\sum_{j} h_j f^j$ is similar.)
  Hence $\mathrm{rad}(J) = I(G(f))$ is a prime ideal, or $G(f)$ is irreducible.

\item[(5)]
  As $G(f)$ is an affine variety,
  the map $\alpha: V \to G(f)$ defined by
  \[
    \alpha: (a_1,\ldots,a_n) \mapsto (a_1,\ldots,a_n,f(a_1,\ldots,a_n))
  \]
  is a polynomial map. (Here $t_1 = x_1, \ldots, t_n = x_n$ and $t_{n+1} = f$.)

\item[(6)]
  By Problem 2.10, the projection map $\mathrm{pr}$ is a polynomial map.
  Also note that $\mathrm{pr} \circ \alpha = 1_{V}$
  and $\alpha \circ \mathrm{pr} = 1_{G(f)}$.
  Therefore, $V \cong G(f)$ as an affine variety isomorphism.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Similar to Problem 2.8(a), $\varphi$ is a polynomial map.

  \[
    V = V(y^2-x^3) = \{ (t^2,t^3) \in \mathbf{A}^2(k) : t \in k \}.

  \emph{Show that $\varphi$ is injective.}
  Suppose $(t^2, t^3) = (s^2, s^3)$ for some $t, s \in k$.
  If $t = 0$, then $s = 0$.
  If $t \neq 0$, then $t = \frac{t^3}{t^2} = \frac{s^3}{s^2} = s$.
  In any case, $t = s$ whenever $(t^2, t^3) = (s^2, s^3)$.

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $\varphi$ is not an isomorphism.}
  It suffices to show that $\widetilde{\varphi}(\Gamma(V)) \subsetneq \Gamma(\mathbf{A}^{1})$
  by Proposition 1.
  For any $f \in \Gamma(V)$,
  \[
    \widetilde{\varphi}(f)(t) = (f \circ \varphi)(t) = f(t^2,t^3) \in k[t^2,t^3].

  Hence,
  \[
    \widetilde{\varphi}(\Gamma(V)) \subseteq k[t^2,t^3] \subsetneq k[t] = \Gamma(\mathbf{A}^{1}).

  (Here note that $t \not\in k[t^2,t^3]$ but $t \in k[t]$.)

  Show that $Y = V$.}
  Similar to Problem 2.8(a).
  It suffices to show that $(x,y) \in Y$ for any $(x,y) \in V$.
  If $x = 0$, then $y = 0$ or $(x,y) = (0,0) \in Y$ whenever $t = \pm 1$.
  (In fact, $(0,0) = (t^2-1, t(t^2-1))$ iff $t^2-1 = 0$ iff $t = \pm 1$ in any field.)
  If $x \neq 0$, define
  \[
    t = \frac{y}{x} \in k.
  \]
  So $y = tx$ and thus
  \[
    0 = y^2 - x^2(x+1) = t^2 x^2 - x^2(x+1) = x^2(t^2 - (x+1)).
  \]
  Since $x \neq 0$ and $k$ is a field, we have
  \[
    t^2 - (x+1) = 0
    \Longleftrightarrow x = t^2 - 1.
  \]
  Hence, $y = tx = t(t^2 - 1)$ and therefore $(x,y) \in Y$.

\item[(2)]
  By (1), $\varphi$ is surjective and $\varphi(\pm 1) = (0,0)$.

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $\varphi$ is injective except that $\varphi(\pm 1) = (0, 0)$.}

  It suffices to show that $t = s$
  whenever $(t^2-1, t(t^2-1)) = (s^2-1, s(s^2-1)) \neq (0,0)$.
  In fact, by assumption we have $t^2-1 = s^2-1 \neq 0$ by assumption.

  If $t \neq 0$, then $t = \frac{t^6 t^4}{t^9} = \frac{s^6 s^4}{s^9} = s$.
  In any case, $t = s$ whenever $(t^9, t^6, t^4) = (s^9, s^6, s^4)$.

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $f$ is not an isomorphism.}
  It suffices to show that $\widetilde{f}(\Gamma(V)) \subsetneq \Gamma(\mathbf{A}^{1})$
  by Proposition 1.
  For any $g \in \Gamma(V)$,
  \[
    \widetilde{f}(g)(t) = (g \circ f)(t) = g(t^9,t^6,t^4) \in k[t^4,t^6,t^9].
  \]
  Hence,
  \[
    \widetilde{\varphi}(\Gamma(V)) \subseteq k[t^4,t^6,t^9] \subsetneq k[t] = \Gamma(\mathbf{A}^{1}).

\subsubsection*{Problem 2.14.* (Linear subvariety)}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 2.14.* (Linear subvariety)}
\emph{A set $V \subseteq \mathbf{A}^n(k)$
is called a \textbf{linear subvariety} of $\mathbf{A}^n(k)$ if
$V = V(f_1,\ldots,f_r)$ for some polynomials $f_i$ of degree $1$.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that if $t$ is an affine change of coordinates on $\mathbf{A}^n(k)$,
  then $V^{t}$ is also a linear subvariety of $\mathbf{A}^n(k)$.}

  show that there is an affine change of coordinates $t$ of $\mathbf{A}^n$

  So $V$ is a variety.}

\item[(c)]
  \emph{Show that the $m$ that appears in part (b) is independent of the choice of $t$.
  It is called the dimension of $V$.
  Then $V$ is then isomorphic (as a variety) to $\mathbf{A}^m(k)$.

  $V(x_{m+1},\ldots,x_n)^{t} = V(x_{s+1},\ldots,x_n)$, $m < s$;
  show that $t_{m+1},\ldots,t_n$ would be dependent.)} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Say $t = (t_1,\ldots,t_n)$ is an affine change of coordinates,
  and $V = V(f_1,\ldots,f_r)$ for some polynomials $f_i$ of degree $1$.

\item[(2)]
  $V(f_1, \ldots, f_r)$ is the set of all solutions of the system of linear equations:
  \begin{align*}
    f_1 &= a_{11} x_1 + \cdots + a_{1n} x_n - b_1 = 0, \\
    &\cdots \\
    f_r &= a_{r1} x_1 + \cdots + a_{rn} x_n - b_r = 0.
  \end{align*}
  Write $Ax = b$ and $V = V(Ax = b)$ where
  \[
    A =
    \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}
    a_{11} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    a_{r1} & \cdots & a_{rn}
    \end{pmatrix}}_{\in \mathsf{M}_{r \times n}(k)},
    \qquad
    x =
    \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}
    x_1 \\
    \vdots \\
    x_{n}
    \end{pmatrix}}_{\in \mathsf{M}_{n \times 1}(k)},
    \qquad
    b =
    \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}
    b_1 \\
    \vdots \\
    b_{r}
    \end{pmatrix}}_{\in \mathsf{M}_{r \times 1}(k)}.
  \]

\item[(3)]
  Linear algebra says that Gaussian elimination transforms $(A|b)$ into its
  reduced row echelon form $(A'|b')$.
  Therefore, $V(Ax = b) = V(A'x = b')$.

\item[(4)]
  If $V(f_1, \ldots, f_r) = \varnothing$, nothing to do.
  If $V(f_1, \ldots, f_r) \neq \varnothing$, then
  \[
    V(f_1, \ldots, f_r) = V(g_1, \ldots, g_m)
  \]
  where $m = \mathrm{rank}(A)$ is the number of nonzero rows in $A'$ ($m \leq r, n$)
  and $g_i = a'_{i1} x_1 + \cdots + a'_{in} x_n - b'_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$.
  ($a'_{ij}$ is the entry of the matrix $A'$.)

\item[(5)]
  Now given any $f + I(V) \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I(V)$,
  we replace the leading term $x_{i_1}$ of $g_1$ by $x_{i_1} - g_1$ to get
  \[
    f + I(V)
    = \: f(x_1, \cdots,
      \underbrace{x_{i_1} - g_1}_{\text{$i_1$th position}}, \cdots, x_n) + I(V)
    := \: f_1 + I(V)
  \]
  where $f_1 \in k[x_1,\ldots,\widehat{x_{i_1}}\ldots,x_n]$.
  Continue this process to replace each leading term $x_{i_j}$ of $g_j$ by $x_{i_j} - g_j$ to get
  one by one to get
  \begin{align*}
    f + I(V) &= f_1 + I(V)
      \text{ where } f_1 \in k[x_1,\ldots,\widehat{x_{i_1}}\ldots,x_n]. \\
    & \cdots \\
    f_{m-1} + I(V) &= f_m + I(V)
      \text{ where } f_m \in k[x_1,\ldots,\widehat{x_{i_1}},\ldots,\widehat{x_{i_m}}\ldots,x_n].
  \end{align*}
  Hence, a routine shows that there is a ring isomorphism
  \[
    \alpha: k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I(V) \to
    \underbrace{k[x_1,\ldots,\widehat{x_{i_1}},\ldots,\widehat{x_{i_m}}\ldots,x_n]}_{\text{a domain}}
  \]
  sending $f$ to $f_m$.
  Therefore, $V$ is a variety.

\item[(6)]
  As $I(V) = (f_1, \ldots, f_r)$,
  $I(V)^{t} = (f_1^{t}, \ldots, f_r^{t})$ where each $f_i^{t}$ is linear.
  Thus $V^{t} = V(I(V)^{t}) = V(f_1^{t}, \ldots, f_r^{t})$
  is also a linear subvariety of $\mathbf{A}^n(k)$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Suppose $A \in \mathsf{M}_{r \times n}(k)$ is of rank $n - m$.
  Linear algebra says that there exist invertible matrices
  $B \in \mathsf{M}_{r \times r}(k)$ and $C \in \mathsf{M}_{n \times n}(k)$
  such that $D = BAC$, where
  \[
    D = BAC =
    \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}
    O_1 & O_2 \\
    O_3 & I_{n-m}
    \end{pmatrix}}_{\in \mathsf{M}_{r \times n}(k)}
  \]
  in which $I_{n-m} \in \mathsf{M}_{(n-m) \times (n-m)}(k)$ is the identity matrix
  and $O_1$, $O_2$, and $O_3$ are zero matrices.

\item[(2)]
  Let $t'$ be the linear map corresponding to the matrix $C$.
  So
  \begin{align*}
    V^{t'}
    &= V(Ax = b)^{t'} \\
    &= V(ACx = b) \\
    &= V(BACx = Bb)
      &(\text{$B$: invertible}) \\
    &= V(Dx = Bb) \\
    &= V(-\beta_1, \cdots, -\beta_m, x_{m+1} - \beta_{m+1}, \cdots, x_n - \beta_n)
      &(V \neq \varnothing) \\
    &= V(x_{m+1} - \beta_{m+1}, \cdots, x_n - \beta_n)
  \end{align*}
  where $Bb =
  \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}
    \beta_1 \\
    \vdots \\
    \beta_n
  \end{pmatrix}}_{\in \mathsf{M}_{n \times 1}(k)}$.

\item[(3)]
  Let $t''$ be the translation corresponding to the matrix $Bb$.
  Let $t = t'' \circ t'$ be the desired affine change of coordinates.
  Therefore,
  \begin{align*}
    V^{t}
    &= (V^{t'})^{t''} \\
    &= V(x_{m+1} - \beta_{m+1}, \cdots, x_n - \beta_n)^{t''} \\
    &= V(x_{m+1}, \cdots, x_n).
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (c).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Linear algebra says that
  the rank of any matrix is the maximal number of its linearly independent rows,
  which is uniquely determined.
  Therefore, $\dim(V) = n - \mathrm{rank}(A|b) = n - \mathrm{rank}(A'|b')$ is uniquely determined.

\item[(2)]
  $V$ is then isomorphic to $\mathbf{A}^m(k)$ as a variety.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 2.15.* (Line)}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 2.15.* (Line)}
\emph{Let $P = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)$, $Q = (b_1, \ldots, b_n)$ be distinct points of $\mathbf{A}^{n}$.
The \textbf{line} through $P$ and $Q$ is defined to be
$\{ ( a_1 + s(b_1-a_1), \ldots, a_n + s(b_n-a_n) ) : s \in k \}$.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that if $L$ is the line through $P$ and $Q$, and $t$ is an affine change of coordinates,
  then $t(L)$ is the line through $t(P)$ and $t(Q)$.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that a line is a linear subvariety of dimension $1$,
  and that a linear subvariety of dimension $1$ is the line through any two of its points.}

\item[(c)]
  \emph{Show that, in $\mathbf{A}^{2}$, a line is the same thing as a hyperplane.}

\item[(d)]
  \emph{Let $P, P' \in \mathbf{A}^{2}$, $L_1$, $L_2$ two distinct lines through $P$,
  $L'_1$, $L'_2$ distinct lines through $P'$.
  Show that there is an affine change of coordinates $t$ of $\mathbf{A}^{2}$
  such that $t(P) = P'$ and $t(L_i) = L'_i$, $i = 1, 2$.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write $t = (t_1,\ldots,t_n)$ as
  \[
    t_i = \sum_{j} c_{ij} x_j + c_{i0}.
  \]
  Take any point $P_{s} = ( a_1 + s(b_1-a_1), \ldots, a_n + s(b_n-a_n) ) \in L$
  for some $s \in k$.
  (In particular, $P_0 = P$ and $P_1 = Q$.)

\item[(2)]
  As
  \begin{align*}
    t_i(P_{s})
    =& \: \sum_{j} c_{ij}(a_j + s(b_j-a_j)) + c_{i0} \\
    =& \: \left( \sum_{j} c_{ij} a_j + c_{i0} \right) \\
      & \: + s \left[ \left( \sum_{j} c_{ij} b_j + c_{i0} \right)
        - \left( \sum_{j} c_{ij} a_j + c_{i0} \right) \right] \\
    =& t_i(P) + s(t_i(Q) - t_i(P)),
  \end{align*}
  we have
  \begin{align*}
    t(L) =& \: \{ (t_1(P) + s(t_1(Q) - t_1(P)), \ldots, t_n(P) + s(t_n(Q) - t_n(P))) \\
      & \: \qquad : s \in k\}.
  \end{align*}
  Moreover, $t(P) \in t(L)$ as $s = 0$ and $t(Q) \in t(L)$ as $s = 1$.
  Therefore, $t(L)$ is the line through $t(P)$ and $t(Q)$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Note that $a_{\alpha} \neq b_{\alpha}$ for some $1 \leq \alpha \leq n$ since $P \neq Q$.
  Write
  \[
    L
    =
    V\left( x_i = a_i + \frac{x_{\alpha}-a_{\alpha}}{b_{\alpha}-a_{\alpha}}(b_i - a_i)
      : 1 \leq i \leq n \right).
  \]
  (Here we solve $s = \frac{x_{\alpha}-a_{\alpha}}{b_{\alpha}-a_{\alpha}}$
  and then replace $s$ in the equation $x_i = a_i + t(b_i - b_i)$.)
  By Problem 2.14, $L$ is a linear subvariety.

\item[(2)]
  Note that
  \begin{align*}
    n - \dim(L)
    &= \text{the rank of the corresponding augmented matrix $(A'|b')$} \\
    &= \text{the maximal number of the linearly independent rows of $(A'|b')$} \\
    &= n - 1,
  \end{align*}
  which is uniquely determined.
  Therefore, $\dim(V) = 1$.

\item[(3)]
  Conversely, $\dim(V) = 1$ implies that $\mathrm{rank}(A'|b') = n - 1$.
  So all leading terms are all $x_i$ except only one $x_j$ for some $j$.
  Hence $V$ is of the form
  \[
    V
    = (x_i + a_{ij} x_j = b_i)
  \]
  for $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $i \neq j$.
  So
  \begin{align*}
    V
    &= \{ (b_1 - a_{1j}s, \ldots,
      \underbrace{s}_{\text{$j$th position}}, \ldots, b_n - a_{nj}s) : s \in k \} \\
    &= \{ (b_1 + s((b_1-a_{1j}) - b_1), \ldots,
      \underbrace{0 + s(1 - 0)}_{\text{$j$th position}}, \ldots, \\
      & \: \qquad (b_n + s((b_n-a_{nj}) - b_n) : s \in k \}
  \end{align*}
  is a line passing
  \begin{align*}
    P &= (b_1, \ldots, 0, \ldots, b_n) \\
    Q &= (b_1-a_{1j}, \ldots, 1, \ldots, b_n-a_{nj})
  \end{align*}
  with $P \neq Q$ (since they are different in the $j$th position).
  (Here we can change $P$ and $Q$ to any two different points on $V$.)
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (c).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  A line $L \subseteq \mathbf{A}^{2}$ is $V(x+ay=b)$ or $V(x+ay=b)$ by (b).
  In any case, $L$ is a hyperplane in $\mathbf{A}^{2}$.

\item[(2)]
  Conversely, given any hyperplane $V = V(ax + by + c = 0) \subseteq \mathbf{A}^{2}$
  where $a$ and $b$ are not all zero.
  Might assume that $a \neq 0$. (The case $b \neq 0$ is similar.)
  So
  \[
    V = \left\{ \left(-\frac{c}{a}-\frac{b}{a}s, s\right) : s \in k \right\}
  \]
  is a line passing $\left(-\frac{c}{a}, 0\right)$ and $\left(-\frac{c+b}{a}, 1\right)$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (d).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  It suffices to show that there is a bijective affine change of coordinates $t$ of $\mathbf{A}^{2}$
  such that $t(P) = (0,0)$, $t(L_1) = V(x = 0)$ and $t(L_2) = V(y = 0)$.
  Write $P = (p_1, p_2)$ and $L_i = a_i x + b_i y + c_i$ for $i = 1, 2$.

\item[(2)]
  Let $t'' = (t''_1, t''_2)$ be a translation defined by
  \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      t''_1 \\
      t''_2
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \begin{pmatrix}
        x - p_1 \\
        y - p_2
      \end{pmatrix}.
  \]
  So ${L_1}^{t''} = a_1 x + b_1 y$ and ${L_2}^{t''} = a_2 x + b_2 y$.
  Let
  \[
    A = \begin{pmatrix}
      a_1 & b_1 \\
      a_2 & b_2
    \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  and $t' = (t'_1, t'_2)$ be a linear map defined by
  \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      t'_1 \\
      t'_2
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \frac{1}{\det(A)}
      \begin{pmatrix}
        b_2 & -b_1 \\
        -a_2 & a_1
      \end{pmatrix}
      \begin{pmatrix}
        x \\
        y
      \end{pmatrix}.
  \]
  ($t'$ is well-defined since $L_1$ and $L_2$ are distinct lines and thus $\det(A) \neq 0$.)
  Write $t = (t_1, t_2) = t' \circ t''$.
  So
  \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      t_1 \\
      t_2
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \frac{1}{\det(A)}
      \begin{pmatrix}
        b_2 & -b_1 \\
        -a_2 & a_1
      \end{pmatrix}
      \begin{pmatrix}
        x - p_1 \\
        y - p_2
      \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  and
  \begin{align*}
    L_1^{t} = ({L_1}^{t''})^{t'} = x \\
    L_2^{t} = ({L_2}^{t''})^{t'} = y.
  \end{align*}

\item[(3)]
  Conversely, define an affine change of coordinates $s = (s_1, s_2)$ of $\mathbf{A}^{2}$
  by
  \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      s_1 \\
      s_2
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \begin{pmatrix}
      a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 \\
      a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2
    \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  so that $x^{s} = L_1$ and $y^{s} = L_2$.

\item[(4)]
  By (2)(3), the statement in (1) is established.

\subsubsection*{Problem 2.16.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 2.16.}
\emph{Let $k = \mathbb{C}$. Give $\mathbf{A}^n(\mathbb{C}) = \mathbb{C}^n$ the usual topology
(obtained by identifying $\mathbb{C}$ with $\mathbb{R}^2$,
and hence $\mathbb{C}^n$ with $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$).
Recall that a topological space X is path-connected if
for any $P, Q \in X$, there is a continuous mapping $\gamma: [0, 1] \to X$
such that $\gamma(0) = P$, $\gamma(1) = Q$.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathbb{C} - S$ is path-connected for any finite set $S$.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Let $V$ be an algebraic set in $\mathbf{A}^n(\mathbb{C})$.
  Show that $\mathbf{A}^n(\mathbb{C}) - V$ is path-connected.
  (Hint: If $P, Q \in \mathbf{A}^n(\mathbb{C}) - V$, let $L$ be the line through $P$ and $Q$.
  Then $L \cap V$ is finite, and $L$ is isomorphic to $\mathbf{A}^1(\mathbb{C})$.)} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Regard $\mathbb{C}^n$ as $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.
  Given any $P, Q \in \mathbb{C}^n - S$.
  Write $S := \{ P_1, \ldots, P_m \} \subseteq \mathbb{C}^n$.

\item[(2)]
  Let $L_{P_i}$ (resp. $L'_{P_i}$) be a line passing $P$ (resp. $Q$) and $P_i$
  for every $P_i \in S$.
  (It is well-defined since $P, Q$ are not in $S$.)
  So $\mathscr{C} := \{ L_{P_i} : P_i \in S \}$
  (resp. $\mathscr{C}' := \{ L'_{P_i} : P_i \in S \}$)
  is a collection of finitely many lines.

\item[(3)]
  Consider a unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{2n-1}(P)$ centered at $P$.
  \[
    \left( \bigcup_{L_i \in \mathscr{C}} L_i \right) \bigcap \mathbb{S}^{2n-1}(P)
  \]
  is again a finite set (of order $\leq 2|S| = 2m$).
  Since $\mathbb{S}^{2n-1}$ is infinite,
  we can always take a line $L$ passing $P$ and some point in $\mathbb{S}^{2n-1}(P)$
  where $L \cap S = \varnothing$.

\item[(4)]
  Similarly, we take a line $L'$ passing $Q$ and some point in $\mathbb{S}^{2n-1}(Q)$
  where $L' \cap S = \varnothing$ and $L' \cap L \neq \varnothing$.
  (There are only two points in $\mathbb{S}^{2n-1}(Q)$ such that $L' \cap L = \varnothing$.
  Note that $\mathbb{S}^{2n-1}$ is infinite.)

\item[(5)]
  Take any point $A \in L' \cap L$.
  So there is a path from $P$ to $A$ (on a segment containted in $L$)
  and then to $Q$ (on a segment containted in $L'$).
  Therefore, $\mathbb{C}^n - S$ is path-connected.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Given any $P, Q \in \mathbf{A}^n(\mathbb{C}) - V$.
  Let $L$ be the line through $P$ and $Q$.
  To show $\mathbf{A}^n(\mathbb{C}) - V$ is path-connected,
  it suffices to show that
  \[
    L - V = L - (V \cap L)
  \]
  is path-connected.

\item[(2)]
  Similar to Problem 1.12, we have $V \cap L$ is finite.
  In fact, write $V = (f_1, \ldots, f_r)$ and
  $L = \{ ( a_1 + t(b_1-a_1), \ldots, a_n + t(b_n-a_n) ) : t \in k \}$
  where $P = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ and $Q = (b_1, \ldots, b_n)$.
  Then
  \begin{align*}
    V \cap L
    &= \bigcap_{i} (V(f_i) \cap L) \\
    &= \bigcap_{i} \{ f_i(a_1 + t(b_1-a_1), \ldots, a_n + t(b_n-a_n)) = 0 : t \in k \} \\
    &= \bigcap_{i} \text{ finite set } \\
    &= \text{finite set}.
  \end{align*}
  Here $f_i(a_1 + t(b_1-a_1), \ldots, a_n + t(b_n-a_n))$ is a nonzero polynomial
  since $P, Q \not\in V(f_i)$.

\item[(3)]
  Note that the path-connectedness is a topological invariant under homeomorphisms.
  Since any line is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^1$,
  $L - V$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^1 - S$ for some finite set $S$
  (by (2)).
  By (a), $L - V$ is path-connected and so is $\mathbf{A}^n(\mathbb{C}) - V$.

      \bigcap_{z = \overline{f}/\overline{g}} V(\overline{g}).

  \item[(b)]
    By (a), $\{ (0,0) \}$ contains the the pole set of $z$.
    (As the denominator $x = 0$, we solve the equation $y^2 - x^2(x+1) = 0$ to get $y = 0$.)

    So
    \begin{align*}
      & \: z = \overline{y}/\overline{x} = \overline{f}/\overline{g} \\

      y(g + hy) = x(f + hx(x+1)) \in (x) \\
      \Longrightarrow & \:
      g + hy \in (x) \\
     \Longrightarrow & \:
      g(0,0) = 0,
    \end{align*}
    which is absurd.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(2)]
\emph{Show that the pole set of $z^2$ is empty.}
  Note that
  $z^2 = \overline{y^2}/\overline{x^2} = \overline{x+1}$.
  So the pole set of $z^2$ is

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 2.18.}
\emph{Let $\mathscr{O}_P(V)$ be the local ring of a variety $V$ at a point $P$.
Show that there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the prime ideals in $\mathscr{O}_P(V)$
and the subvarieties of $V$ that pass through $P$.
(Hint: If $I$ is prime in $\mathscr{O}_P(V)$,
$I \cap \Gamma(V)$ is prime in $\Gamma(V)$,
and $I$ is generated by $I \cap \Gamma(V)$; use Problem 2.2.)} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write $P = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ and $\mathfrak{m} := (x_1-a_1, \ldots, x_n - a_n)$.
  It suffices to show that
  there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the prime ideals in $\mathscr{O}_P(V)$
  and prime ideals in $\Gamma(V)$ which is contained in $I(V(P)) = \mathfrak{m}$
  by Problem 2.2.

\item[(2)]
  If $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime in $\mathscr{O}_P(V)$,
  $\mathfrak{p} \cap \Gamma(V)$ is prime in $\Gamma(V)$
  since $\Gamma(V)$ is a subring of $\mathscr{O}_P(V)$.
  Note that $\mathfrak{p} \subseteq \mathfrak{m}_P(V)$
  and thus
  \[
    \mathfrak{p} \cap \Gamma(V)
    \subseteq \mathfrak{m}_P(V) \cap \Gamma(V)
    = (x_1-a_1, \ldots, x_n - a_n).
  \]

\item[(3)]
  Conversely,
  if $\mathfrak{q}$ is prime in $\Gamma(V)$ which is contained in
  $\mathfrak{m}$
  then we need to show that
  $\mathfrak{p} := \mathfrak{q}\mathscr{O}_P(V)$ is prime in $\mathscr{O}_P(V)$.

\item[(4)]
  Note that $\mathfrak{p}$ is proper
  (since $\mathfrak{q} \subseteq \mathfrak{m}$).
  Suppose $\frac{a}{b} \frac{c}{d} \in \mathfrak{p}$ with $b(P) \neq 0$ and $d(P) \neq 0$.
  Hence
  \[
    ac = \frac{a}{b} \frac{c}{d} \cdot (bd)
    \in \mathfrak{p} \cap \Gamma(V)
    = \mathfrak{q}.
  \]
  By the primality of $\mathfrak{q}$, might assume that $a \in \mathfrak{q}$.
  (The case $c \in \mathfrak{q}$ is the same.)
  So that $\frac{a}{b} = a \cdot \frac{1}{b} \in \mathfrak{q}\mathscr{O}_P(V) = \mathfrak{p}$.
  Therefore,
  $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime.

  Consider the polynomial

  $\beta$ is not a constant polynomial since $V(\beta) = \{ (0,0) \}$ by (1)(2).

  Suppose $f = \overline{x}/\overline{y} = \overline{a}/\overline{b}$
  where $\overline{b}(P) \neq 0$.
  Similar to (2),
  \[

  Similarly, $z_0 = 0$ by noting that $bz - aw = h(xw - yz)$ for some $h \in k[x,y,z,w]$.

\emph{Show that the order function on $K$ is independent of the choice of uniformizing parameter.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that a uniformizing parameter is unique up to a unit.}
  Suppose $t$ and $t'$ are two uniformizing parameters
  for a discrete valuation ring $R$ with the quotient field $K$.
  Since $R$ is a DVR, the maximal ideal is
  \[
    \mathfrak{m} = (t) = (s).
  \]
  As $s \in (t)$, there is an element $a \in R$ such that $s = at$.
  As $s$ is irreducible (by the maximality of $\mathfrak{m}$),
  $a$ is a unit or $t$ is a unit (which is impossible).
  Hence $s = at$ for some unit $a \in R$.

\item[(2)]
  For any $z \in K$, write
  \[
    z = ut^n = v{s}^{m}
  \]
  for some units $u, v$ and integers $n \geq m$. (The case $n \leq m$ is similar.)
  Replace $s = at$ to get $u t^n = v a^m t^m$.
  So $t^{n - m} = u^{-1}v a^m$ is a unit.
  Hence, $m = n$, or the order function on $K$ is independent of the choice of uniformizing parameter.

  is also a DVR, with uniformizing parameter $t = 1/x$.} \\\\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  By Proposition 7 in \S 2.4,
  $\mathscr{O}_{a}(V)$ is a (Noetherian) local domain.
  It suffices to show that $t = x - a$ is an irreducible element in $\mathscr{O}_{a}(V)$
  such that every nonzero $z \in \mathscr{O}_{a}(V)$ might be written uniquely
  in the form $z = ut^n$, $u$ a unit in $\mathscr{O}_{a}(V)$, $n$ a nonnegative integer
  (by Proposition 4).

\item[(2)]
  Write $z = f/g \in \mathscr{O}_{a}(V)$ where $g(a) \neq 0$.
  By Problem 1.7,
  \[
    f = \sum_{i=0}^{\deg(f)} \lambda_i (x-a)^{i}.
  \]
  Let $n$ be the smallest integer such that $\lambda_n \neq 0$.
  (Such $n$ is existed since $z$ or $f$ is nonzero.)
  Hence, $f = f_1 (x-a)^n$
  where $f_1 = \sum_{i=n}^{\deg(f)} \lambda_i (x-a)^{i-n} \neq 0$ and $f_1(a) = \lambda_n \neq 0$.
  So
  \[
    z = f/g = (f_1/g) (x-a)^n.
  \]
  Here $f_1/g$ is a unit in $\mathscr{O}_{a}(V)$.
  Besides, it is easy to show that $n$ is unique by the similar argument in Problem 2.23.
  Hence, $\mathscr{O}_{a}(V)$ is a DVR with uniformizing parameter $t = x - a$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathscr{O}_{\infty}$ is a subring of $k(x)$.}
  Clearly, $1 = 1/1 \in \mathscr{O}_{\infty}$.
  Also, given any $f = a/b, g = c/d \in \mathscr{O}_{\infty}$.
  So
  \begin{align*}
    f - g &= a/b - c/d = \frac{ad - bc}{bd} \in \mathscr{O}_{\infty} \\
    fg &= a/b \cdot c/d = \frac{ac}{bd} \in \mathscr{O}_{\infty}
  \end{align*}
  since
  \begin{align*}
    \deg(ad - bc)
    &\leq \max(\deg(ad), \deg(bc)) \\
    &\leq \max(\deg(a)+\deg(d), \deg(b)+\deg(c)) \\
    &\leq \max(\deg(b)+\deg(d), \deg(b)+\deg(d)) \\
    &\leq \deg(b) + \deg(d) \\
    &\leq \deg(bd)
  \end{align*}
  and
  \[
    \deg(ac) = \deg(a) + \deg(c) \leq \deg(b) + \deg(d) = \deg(bd).
  \]
  (Here we define $\deg(0) = -\infty$ by convention.)
  By the subring test, $\mathscr{O}_{\infty}$ is a subring of $k(x)$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathscr{O}_{\infty}$ is a DVR.}
  Clearly $\mathscr{O}_{\infty}$ is not a field
  since $1/x \in \mathscr{O}_{\infty}$ but $x = x/1 \not\in \mathscr{O}_{\infty}$.
  Let $t = 1/x$ be an irreducible element of $\mathscr{O}_{\infty}$.
  ($\deg(x) = 1$ implies the irreducibility of $t$.)
  Now for any nonzero $f/g \in \mathscr{O}_{\infty}$, write
  \[
    f/g = ((f x^n)/g) (1/x^n) = ((f x^n)/g) t^n
  \]
  where $n := \deg(g) - \deg(f) \geq 0$.
  Note that $\deg(fx^n) = \deg(f) + n = \deg(g)$.
  So $(f x^n)/g$ is a unit since the inverse $g/(f x^n)$ is also in $\mathscr{O}_{\infty}$.
  Besides, it is easy to show that $n$ is unique by the similar argument in Problem 2.23.
  Hence, $\mathscr{O}_{\infty}$ is a DVR.

\]
is a DVR with quotient field $\mathbb{Q}$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let
  \[
    \mathbb{Z}_p
    = \{ r \in \mathbb{Q} : r = a/b, \: a,b \in \mathbb{Z}, \: p \nmid b \}
  \]
  be the set of all $p$-adic integers.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a subring of $\mathbb{Q}$.}
  Clearly, $1 = 1/1 \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ (since $p \nmid 1$).
  Also, given any $r = a/b, s = c/d \in \mathbb{Z}_p$.
  So
  \begin{align*}
    r - s &= a/b - c/d = \frac{ad - bc}{bd} \in \mathbb{Z}_p \\
    rs &= a/b \cdot c/d = \frac{ac}{bd} \in \mathbb{Z}_p
  \end{align*}
  since $p \nmid b$, $p \nmid d$ and $p$ is a prime number.
  By the subring test, $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a subring of $\mathbb{Q}$.

\item[(3)]
  Note that $\mathbb{Z}_p \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ is a domain
  and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is not a field (since $p = p/1 \in \mathbb{Z}_p$
  but $p^{-1} = 1/p \not\in \mathbb{Z}_p$).

\item[(4)]
  Let $t = p$ be an irreducible element in $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
  For the irreducibility of $t = p$, we write $p = a/b \cdot c/d = \frac{ac}{bd}$
  where $p \nmid b$, $p \nmid d$. So $pbd = ac$ or
  \[
    1 = \mathrm{ord}_p(ac) = \mathrm{ord}_p(a) + \mathrm{ord}_p(c).
  \]
  Here $\mathrm{ord}_p: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$
  is defined by $\mathrm{ord}_p(a) = n$ where
  $n$ is the largest number such that $p^n$ divides $a$,
  that is, $p^n \mid a$ and $p^{n+1} \nmid a$.
  So $(\mathrm{ord}_p(a), \mathrm{ord}_p(c)) = (0,1)$ or $(1,0)$.
  Hence, $a/b$ or $c/d$ is a unit in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, or $p$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}_p$.

\item[(5)]
  For any nonzero $r = a/b \in \mathbb{Z}_p$, $a \neq 0$ can be written as
  $a = p^n c$ for some nonnegative integer $n$ and $c \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ uniquely.
  Hence
  \[
    r = a/b = (c/b) p^n = (c/b) t^n,
  \]
  where $c/b$ is a unit and $n$ is a nonnegative integer.
  Besides, it is easy to show that $n$ is unique by the similar argument in Problem 2.23.
  By Proposition 4, $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a DVR.

\item[(6)]
  \emph{Show that the quotient field of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is $\mathbb{Q}$.}
  It suffices to show that $r$ is in the quotient field of $\mathbb{Z}_p$
  if $r \in \mathbb{Q} - \mathbb{Z}_p$.
  Note that $r \neq 0$.
  Write $r = a/b$ with $\gcd(a,b) = 1$.
  As $r \not\in \mathbb{Z}_p$, $p \mid b$ and $p \nmid a$.
  Therefore, $1/r = b/a \in \mathbb{Z}_p$, or $r$ is in the quotient field of $\mathbb{Z}_p$.

\emph{Show that the DVR's of Problem 2.24 are
the only DVR's with quotient field $k(x)$ that contain $k$.
Show that those of Problem 2.25 are the only DVR's with quotient field $\mathbb{Q}$.} \\



\emph{Proof (Problem 2.26).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathscr{O}_{a}(V)$ and $\mathscr{O}_{\infty}$
  are the only DVR's with quotient field $k(x)$ that contain $k$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    Let $k \subseteq R \subsetneq k(x)$ be a DVR with quotient field $k(x)$,
    $\mathfrak{m}$ be the unique maximal ideal of $R$.
    $\mathfrak{m} \neq (0)$ and the set of units in $R$ is $R - \mathfrak{m}$.

  \item[(b)]
    There are two possible cases: $x \in R$ or $x \not\in R$.

  \item[(c)]
    Suppose $x \in R$. So $R$ contains $k[x]$ as a subring.
    Consider the subset
    \[
      S := \{ x - a \in k[x] : a \in k \} \cap \mathfrak{m}
      \subseteq \mathfrak{m}.
    \]
    Suppose there were two distinct elements $x - a, x - b \in S$.
    Then $1 \in \mathfrak{m}$, contrary to the maximality of $\mathfrak{m}$.
    Suppose $S = \varnothing$, then every $x - a$ is a unit in $R$.
    Since $k = \overline{k}$, $R = k(x)$ is a field, which is absurd.
    Hence, there is only one $x - a \in \mathfrak{m}$ for one unique $a \in k$
    and other $x - b$ with $b \neq a$ is a unit in $R$.
    Thus, $R \supseteq \mathscr{O}_{a}(V)$
    and $\mathfrak{m}$ contains $(x - a)\mathscr{O}_{a}(V)$,
    which is the maximal ideal of $\mathscr{O}_{a}(V)$.
    By Problem 2.26, $R = \mathscr{O}_{a}(V)$.

  \item[(d)]
    If $x \not\in R$, then $x - a \not\in R$ whenever $a \in k \subseteq R$.
    Hence $(x-a)^{-1} \in \mathfrak{m}$ whenever $a \in k$ by Problem 2.26(a).
    Next, given any $f/g \in \mathscr{O}_{\infty}$, by $k = \overline{k}$ we have
    \[
      f/g = \underbrace{u}_{\in k}
        \underbrace{\frac{x-\alpha_1}{x-\beta_1}}_{\in R} \cdots
        \underbrace{\frac{x-\alpha_n}{x-\beta_n}}_{\in R}
        \underbrace{\frac{1}{x-\beta_{n+1}}}_{\in \mathfrak{m}} \cdots
        \underbrace{\frac{1}{x-\beta_{m}}}_{\in \mathfrak{m}},
    \]
    where $n := \deg(f)$, $m := \deg(g)$ and $n \leq m$.
    Here
    \[
      \frac{x-\alpha_i}{x-\beta_i}
      = \underbrace{1}_{\in k}
        + \underbrace{\frac{\beta_i-\alpha_i}{x-\beta_i}}_{\in \mathfrak{m} \subseteq R} \in R.
    \]
    Therefore, $R \supseteq \mathscr{O}_{\infty}$ and $\mathfrak{m}$
    contains the maximal ideal $x^{-1} \mathscr{O}_{\infty}$ of $\mathscr{O}_{\infty}$.
    By Problem 2.26, $R = \mathscr{O}_{\infty}$.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathbb{Z}_p$ are the only DVR's with quotient field $\mathbb{Q}$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    Let $R \subsetneq \mathbb{Q}$ be a DVR with quotient field $\mathbb{Q}$,
    $\mathfrak{m}$ be the unique maximal ideal of $R$.
    $\mathfrak{m} \neq (0)$ and the set of units in $R$ is $R - \mathfrak{m}$.

  \item[(b)]
    Note that $R \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ contains $\mathbb{Z}$ as a subring.
    Consider the subset
    \[
      S := \{ p \in \mathbb{Z} : \text{$p$ is a prime number} \} \cap \mathfrak{m}
      \subseteq \mathfrak{m}.
    \]

  \item[(c)]
    Suppose there were two distinct prime integers $p, q \in S$.
    By the B\'ezout's identity, there exist integers $a$ and $b$ such that $pa + qb = 1$.
    $1 \in \mathfrak{m}$, contrary to the maximality of $\mathfrak{m}$.

  \item[(d)]
    Suppose no prime integer were in $S$, then every prime integer is a unit in $R$.
    By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, $R = \mathbb{Q}$ is a field, which is absurd.

  \item[(e)]
    By (c)(d), $p \in \mathfrak{m}$ for one unique prime $p \in \mathbb{Z}$.
    Thus, $R \supseteq \mathbb{Z}_p$ by the definition of $\mathbb{Z}_p$
    and $\mathfrak{m}$ contains $p\mathbb{Z}_p$,
    which is the maximal ideal of $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
    By Problem 2.26, $R = \mathbb{Z}_p$.

\emph{An order function on a field $K$ is a function $\varphi$
from $K$ onto $\mathbb{Z} \cup \{ \infty \}$, satisfying:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)]
  \emph{$\varphi(a) = \infty$ if and only if $a = 0$.}

Conversely, show that if $R$ is a DVR with quotient field $K$,
then the function $\mathrm{ord}: K \to \mathbb{Z} \cup \{ \infty \}$ is an order function on $K$.
Giving a DVR with quotient field $K$ is equivalent to defining an order function on $K$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\varphi(1) = 0$.}
  Note that $\varphi(1) = \varphi(1 \cdot 1) = \varphi(1) + \varphi(1)$ by (ii).
  By Property (i) of $\varphi$,
  we cancel $\varphi(1) \in \mathbb{Z}$ on the both side to get $\varphi(1) = 0$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $\varphi(-z) = \varphi(z)$ for all $z \in K$,
  and $\varphi(z^{-1}) = -\varphi(z)$ for all $z \in K - \{0\}$.}
  Note that $\varphi(-1) = 0$
  since $0 = \varphi(1) = \varphi((-1) \cdot (-1)) = \varphi(-1) + \varphi(-1)$ (by (1)).
  Therefore,
  \[
    \varphi(-z) = \varphi((-1) \cdot z) = \varphi(-1) + \varphi(z) = \varphi(z).
  \]
  Besides,
  \[
    0 = \varphi(1) = \varphi(z z^{-1}) = \varphi(z) + \varphi(z^{-1})
  \]
  if $z \neq 0$. So $\varphi(z^{-1}) = -\varphi(z)$ if $z \neq 0$.

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $R = \{z \in K : \varphi(z) \geq 0 \}$ is a ring.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    $R \neq \varnothing$ since $1 \in R$.

  \item[(b)]
    If $a, b \in R$, then
    \[
      \varphi(a-b)
      \geq \min(\varphi(a), \varphi(-b))
      = \min(\varphi(a), \varphi(b))
      \geq 0
    \]
    (by (2)), or $a - b \in R$.

  \item[(c)]
    If $a, b \in R$, then $\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a) + \varphi(b) \geq 0$.
  \end{enumerate}
  By the subring test, $R$ is a subring of $K$.

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $\{ z \in K - \{0\}: \varphi(z) = 0 \}$ is the set of all units in $R$.}
  Given any $z \in K - \{0\}$, we have
  \[
    0 = \varphi(z) + \varphi(z^{-1})
  \]
  (by (2)).
  Hence $z$ is a unit in $R$ iff
  $z, z^{-1} \in R$ iff $\varphi(z) = \varphi(z^{-1}) = 0$.

\item[(5)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathfrak{m} = \{ z \in K : \varphi(z) > 0 \}$ is a maximal ideal of $R$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    If $a, b \in \mathfrak{m}$, then $\varphi(a+b) \geq \min(\varphi(a), \varphi(b)) > 0$.

  \item[(b)]
    If $a \in \mathfrak{m}$ and $r \in R$,
    then $\varphi(ra) = \varphi(r) + \varphi(a) \geq \varphi(a) > 0$.

  \item[(c)]
    By (a)(b), $\mathfrak{m}$ is an ideal of $R$.

  \item[(d)]
    Note that each proper ideal in $R$ does not have any unit, that is,
    such proper ideal is contained in $\{ z \in K : \varphi(z) > 0 \} = \mathfrak{m}$ exactly (by (4)).
    Therefore, $\mathfrak{m}$ is maximal.
    (Such maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ is unique and thus $R$ is a local ring.)
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(6)]
  \emph{Show that $R$ is a DVR.}
  It suffices to show that there is an irreducible element $t \in R$
  such that every nonzero $z \in R$ may be written uniquely in the form $z = ut^n$,
  $u$ a unit in $R$, $n$ a nonnegative integer.
  Since $\varphi$ is surjective, there is an element $t \in R$
  such that $\varphi(t) = 1$.
  Note that $t \neq 0$ and irreducible (by using Property (ii) of $\varphi$).
  Hence for any nonzero $z \in R$ with $n := \varphi(z) \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $n \geq 0$,
  the order of $z t^{-n} \in K$ is
  \[
    \varphi(z t^{-n}) = \varphi(z) - n \varphi(t) = n - n \cdot 1 = 0
  \]
  (by (2)).
  That is, $z t^{-n} = u$ is a unit in $R$ (by (4)).
  Hence $z = ut^n$ for some unit $u \in R$
  and nonnegative integer $n$.
  Note that $n$ is uniquely determined by $\varphi(z)$.
  By Proposition 4, $R$ is a DVR.

\item[(7)]
  \emph{Show that the quotient field of $R$ is $K$.}
  Since $R$ is a DVR, the quotient field of $R$ is contained in $K$.
  Conversely, given any $z \in K$.
  If $\varphi(z) \geq 0$, then $z \in R \subseteq K$.
  If $\varphi(z) < 0$, then $\varphi(z^{-1}) = -\varphi(z) > 0$ or $z^{-1} \in R$.
  Hence $z = 1/z^{-1} \in K$ is in the quotient field of $R$.

\item[(8)]
  \emph{Show that giving a DVR with quotient field $K$
  is equivalent to defining an order function on $K$.}
  It suffices to show that $\mathrm{ord}(\cdot)$ on $K$ defines an order function $\varphi$ on $K$.
  By Problem 2.29,
  it suffices to show that
  \[
    \mathrm{ord}(a + b) \geq \min(\mathrm{ord}(a), \mathrm{ord}(b))
  \]
  if $\mathrm{ord}(a) = \mathrm{ord}(b) := n$.
  Write $a = ut^n, b = vt^n$ where $u, v$ are units in $R$.
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    \mathrm{ord}(a + b)
    &= \mathrm{ord}(ut^n + vt^n) \\
    &= \mathrm{ord}((u+v)t^n) \\
    &= \mathrm{ord}(u+v) + n \\
    &\geq n
      &(u+v \in R) \\
    &= \min(\mathrm{ord}(a), \mathrm{ord}(b)).
  \end{align*}

\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $t$ be a uniformizing parameter for $R$.
  Given any $a, b \in K$.
  Write $a = ut^n, b = vt^m$ where $u, v$ are units in $R$ and $n, m$ are integers.

\item[(2)]
  Since $\mathrm{ord}(a) < \mathrm{ord}(b)$, $n < m$.
  Hence,
  \[
    a + b = (u + vt^{m-n}) t^n.
  \]
  To show that $\mathrm{ord}(a + b) = \mathrm{ord}(a) = n$,
  it suffices to show that $u + vt^{m-n}$ is a unit in $R$.

\item[(3)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  Suppose that $u + vt^{m-n}$ were not a unit.
  Since $R$ is local, the maximal ideal $(t)$ contains all nonunit elements in $R$.
  Hence, $u + vt^{m-n} \in (t)$. As $m - n > 0$, $vt^{m-n} \in (t)$
  and thus a unit $u \in (t)$, contrary to the maximality of $(t)$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Might assume that $\mathrm{ord}(a_1) < \mathrm{ord}(a_j)$ (all $j \neq 1$).
  In particular, $\mathrm{ord}(a_1) < \infty$.

\item[(2)]
  Similar to (a).
  Let $t$ be a uniformizing parameter for $R$.
  Write $a_i = u_i t^{m_i}$ where $u_i$ are units in $R$ and $m_i$ are integers.
  ($i = 1, \ldots, n$.)
  Since $\mathrm{ord}(a_1) < \mathrm{ord}(a_j)$ (all $j \neq 1$), $m_1 < m_j$.
  Hence,
  \[
    a_1 + \cdots + a_n
    = (u_1
      + \underbrace{u_2 t^{m_2 - m_1} + \cdots + u_n t^{m_n - m_1}}_{\in (t)}) t^{m_1}.
  \]
  So $u_1 + u_2 t^{m_2 - m_1} + \cdots + u_n t^{m_n - m_1}$ is a unit in $R$.

\item[(3)]
  By (1)(2),
  \[
    \mathrm{ord}(a_1 + \cdots + a_n) = \mathrm{ord}(a_1) < \infty,
  \]
  or $a_1 + \cdots + a_n \neq 0$
  (since $\mathrm{ord}$ is an order function on $K$).

  for one unique $\lambda_0 \in k$ and $z_0 \in R$.
  Continue this process or by induction, we have the expression
  \[
    z = \lambda_0 + \lambda_1 t + \lambda_2 t^2 + \cdots + \lambda_n t^n + z_n t^{n+1}.

\item[(2)]
  For the uniqueness,
  suppose
  \begin{align*}
    0 = \lambda_0 + \lambda_1 t + \lambda_2 t^2 + \cdots + \lambda_n t^n + z_n t^{n+1}.

      \infty
        &(\lambda_i = 0) \\
      i
        &(\lambda_i \neq 0)
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  since every nonzero element in $k$ is a unit in $k \subseteq R$.
  Also, $\mathrm{ord}(z_n t^{n+1}) = \infty$ if $z_n = 0$;
  $\mathrm{ord}(z_n t^{n+1}) \geq n+1$ if $z_n \neq 0$.

  if $i_0 \neq j$ and $\mathrm{ord}(\lambda_{i_0} t^{i_0}) = i_0 < n+1 \leq \mathrm{ord}(z_n t^{n+1})$.
  By Problem 2.29(b), such $i_0$ does not exist.
  Hence all $\lambda_i = 0$.
  So as $R$ is a domain, $z_n$ is also equal to $0$.

The ring of \textbf{formal power series} over $k$,
written $k[[x]]$,
is defined to be
\[
  \left\{ \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_i x^i : a_i \in k \right\}.
\]
(As with polynomials,
a rigorous definition is best given in terms of sequences
$(a_0,a_1,\ldots)$ of elements in $k$;
here we allow an infinite number of nonzero terms.)
Define the sum by
\[
  \sum a_i x^i + \sum b_i x^i = \sum (a_i + b_i) x^i,
\]
and the (Cauchy) product by
\[
  \left( \sum a_i x^i \right)\left( \sum b_i x^i \right) = \sum c_i x^i,
\]
where $c_i = \sum_{j+k=i} a_j b_k$.
Show that $k[[x]]$ is a ring containing $k[x]$ as a subring.
Show that $k[[x]]$ is a DVR with uniformizing parameter $x$.
Its quotient field is denoted $k((x))$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Two formal power series $\sum a_i x^i$ and $\sum b_i x^i$ in $k[[x]]$
  are considered equal if $a_i = b_i$ for all integers $i \geq 0$.

\item[(2)]
  The zero element in $k[[x]]$ is $0 = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} 0 x^i$, and the multiplicative identity is
  \[
    1 = 1 + 0 x + \cdots + 0 x^n + \cdots.
  \]
  Hence, $k[[x]]$ is a ring (by a tedious argument).
  Moreover, $k[[x]]$ is a domain (again by a tedious argument).

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $k[[x]] \supseteq k[x]$.}
  In fact, for any $f = \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i x^i \in k[x]$, we can write
  \[
    f = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n + 0 x^{n+1} + \cdots \in k[[x]].
  \]

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $f = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_i x^i$ is a unit in $k[[x]]$
  if and only if $a_0 \neq 0$.}
  Suppose $g = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} b_i x^i \in k[[x]]$ such that $fg = 1$.
  Then
  \begin{align*}
    1 &= a_0 b_0, \\
    0 &= \sum_{j=0}^{k} a_j b_{k-j}.
  \end{align*}
  So $f$ is not a unit in $k[[x]]$ if $a_0 = 0$.
  Now if $a_0 \neq 0$ then $b_0 := a_0^{-1} \in k$.
  Then by observing that
  \begin{align*}
    0 = \sum_{j=0}^{k} a_j b_{k-j}
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    a_0 b_k = -\sum_{j=1}^{k} a_j b_{k-j} \\
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    b_k = -b_0 \sum_{j=1}^{k} a_j b_{k-j},
  \end{align*}
  we can solve $b_1, b_2, \ldots$ by induction, and $(b_0, b_1, \ldots)$ gives
  the existence of $g \in k[[x]]$.

\item[(5)]
  By (4), $k[[x]]$ is not a field since $x \in k[[x]]$ but $x^{-1} \not\in k[[x]]$.
  Let $t = x$ be an irreducible element in $k[[x]]$.
  ($\deg(x) = 1$ implies the irreducibility of $t$.)
  Hence every nonzero $f \in k[[x]]$ can be written uniquely in
  the form
  \[
    f = u x^n
  \]
  where $n$ is the smallest integer such that $a_{n} \neq 0$.
  By (4),
  \[
    u = a_n + a_{n+1} x + \cdots
  \]
  is a unit in $k[[x]]$ as $a_n \neq 0$.
  Besides, it is easy to show that $n$ is unique by the similar argument in Problem 2.23.
  Therefore, $k[[x]]$ is a DVR with uniformizing parameter $x$.

    = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \lambda'_i x^i.
  \]
  If there were $\lambda_n \neq \lambda'_n$ for some $n$,
  then Problem 2.30(b) implies that two expressions of $z$
  \begin{align*}
    z
    &= \lambda_0 + \lambda_1 t + \cdots + \lambda_n t^n + z_n t^{n+1} \\
    &= \lambda'_0 + \lambda'_1 t + \cdots + \lambda'_n t^n + z'_n t^{n+1}
  \end{align*}
  are the same. That is, $\lambda_n = \lambda'_n$, which is absurd.
  Hence, $\alpha$ is well-defined.
  Also,
  $0 = 0 + 0 t + 0 t^2 + \cdots + 0 t^n + 0 t^{n+1}$
  implies that $\alpha$ is one-to-one.

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $\alpha$ is addition preserving.}
  Given $a, b \in R$. By Problem 2.30(b),
  \[
    a+b
    = \lambda_0 + \lambda_1 t + \cdots + \lambda_n t^n + c_n t^{n+1}
  \]
  and
  \begin{align*}
    a
    &= \mu_0 + \mu_1 t + \cdots + \mu_n t^n + a_n t^{n+1} \\
    b
    &= \nu_0 + \nu_1 t + \cdots + \nu_n t^n + b_n t^{n+1}
  \end{align*}
  for any integer $n \geq 0$.
  So
  \[
    a+b
    = \underbrace{(\mu_0+\nu_0)}_{\in k}
      + \underbrace{(\mu_1+\nu_1)}_{\in k} t + \cdots
      + \underbrace{(\mu_n+\nu_n)}_{\in k} t^n
      + \underbrace{(a_n+b_n)}_{\in R} t^{n+1}.
  \]
  Since the expression of $a+b$ is unique (by Problem 2.30(b)),
  \[
    \lambda_i = \mu_i + \nu_i
  \]
  for all $i = 0, 1, \ldots, n$.
  Since $n$ is arbitrary, $\lambda_i = \mu_i + \nu_i$ is true for all nonnegative integers.
  Hence, $\alpha(a+b) = \alpha(a) + \alpha(b)$.

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $\alpha$ is multiplication preserving.}
  Given $a, b \in R$. By Problem 2.30(b),
  \[
    ab
    = \lambda_0 + \lambda_1 t + \cdots + \lambda_n t^n + c_n t^{n+1}
  \]
  and
  \begin{align*}
    a
    &= \mu_0 + \mu_1 t + \cdots + \mu_n t^n + a_n t^{n+1} \\
    b
    &= \nu_0 + \nu_1 t + \cdots + \nu_n t^n + b_n t^{n+1}
  \end{align*}
  for any integer $n \geq 0$.
  So
  \begin{align*}
    ab
    =& \: \underbrace{(\mu_0 \nu_0)}_{\in k}
      + \underbrace{(\mu_1 \nu_0 + \mu_0 \nu_1)}_{\in k} t + \cdots \\
      &+ \underbrace{(\mu_n \nu_0 + \mu_{n-1}\nu_1 + \cdots + \mu_1\nu_{n-1} + \mu_0\nu_n)}_{\in k} t^n \\
      &+ \underbrace{(\text{other terms})}_{\in R} t^{n+1}.
  \end{align*}
  Since the expression of $a+b$ is unique (by Problem 2.30(b)),
  \[
    \lambda_i = \sum_{j+k=i} \mu_j \nu_k
  \]
  for all $i = 0, 1, \ldots, n$.
  Since $n$ is arbitrary, $\lambda_i = \sum_{j+k=i} \mu_j + \nu_k$ is true for all nonnegative integers.
  Hence, $\alpha(ab) = \alpha(a)\alpha(b)$.

\item[(5)]
  \emph{Show that $\alpha$ is multiplicative identity preserving.}
  Note that
  \[
    1
    = \underbrace{1}_{\in k}
      + \underbrace{0}_{\in k} t + \cdots
      + \underbrace{0}_{\in k} t^n
      + \underbrace{0}_{\in k} t^{n+1}
  \]
  for every nonnegative integer $n$.
  Hence $\alpha: 1 \mapsto 1 \in k[[x]]$.

\item[(6)]
  By (3)(4)(5), $\alpha$ is a ring homomorphism.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Define the mapping $\beta$ from $K$ to $k((x))$
  by
  \[
    \beta: a/b \mapsto \alpha(a)/\alpha(b)
  \]
  where $a, b \in R$ and $b \neq 0$.

\item[(2)]
  $\beta$ is well-defined since:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    $\alpha(b) \neq 0$ if $b \neq 0$ by the injectivity of $\alpha$.

  \item[(b)]
    The value of $\beta(a/b)$ is independent of the choice of $a/b \in K$
    since $\alpha$ is a ring homomorphism.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(3)]
  Also, $\beta$ is a ring homomorphism since $\alpha$ is a ring homomorphism.

\item[(4)]
  To show that the order function on $k((x))$ restricts to that on $K$,
  it suffices to show that
  \[
    \mathrm{ord}_{R}(z) = \mathrm{ord}_{k[[x]]}(\alpha(z)).
  \]
  In fact,
  \begin{align*}
    m := \mathrm{ord}_{R}(z)
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    z = \lambda_m t^m + \cdots + \lambda_n t^n + z_n t^{n+1} \text{ with } \lambda_m \neq 0 \\
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    \alpha(z) = \lambda_m x^m + \cdots \text{ with } \lambda_m \neq 0 \\
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    \mathrm{ord}_{k[[x]]}(\alpha(z)) = m.
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (c).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  In calculus we have
  \[
    (1-x)^{-1} = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x^i
  \]
  for $|x| < 1$.
  In the ring of formal power series $k[[x]]$, $1-x$ is a unit
  (by (4) in the proof of Problem 2.31) and satisfies
  \[
    (1-x)\left( \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x^i \right) = 1 \in k[[x]].
  \]
  Hence, the power expansion of $(1-x)^{-1}$ is
  \[
    (1-x)^{-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x^i \in k((x)).
  \]

\item[(2)]
  Note that $1+x^2$ is a unit in $k[[x]]$ and satisfies
  \[
    (1+x^2)\left( \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (-1)^i x^{2i} \right)
    = 1 \in k[[x]].
  \]
  Hence, the power expansion of $(1-x)(1+x^2)^{-1}$ is
  \begin{align*}
    (1 - x)\left( \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (-1)^i x^{2i} \right)
    &= \left( \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (-1)^i x^{2i} \right)
      - x\left( \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (-1)^i x^{2i} \right) \\
    &= \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (-1)^i x^{2i} + \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (-1)^{i+1} x^{2i+1} \\
    &= \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (-1)^i x^{i} \in k[[x]].

\emph{Factor $y^3 - 2xy^2 + 2x^2y + x^3$
into linear factors in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $f(x,y) = y^3 - 2xy^2 + 2x^2y + x^3$.
  Then $f_*(x) = 1 - 2x + 2x^3 + x^3$.

\item[(2)]
  Solve $f_*(x) = 0$ over $\mathbb{C}$ by WolframAlpha (a computational knowledge engine) to get
  \begin{align*}
    \alpha_1
    &= - \frac{2}{3} - \frac{10}{3} \sqrt[3]{\frac{2}{79 - 3\sqrt{249}}}
      - \frac{1}{3} \sqrt[3]{\frac{79 - 3\sqrt{249}}{2}} \\
    \alpha_2
    &= - \frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{3}(1 - \sqrt{3}i) \sqrt[3]{\frac{2}{79 - 3\sqrt{249}}}
      + \frac{1}{6}(1 + \sqrt{3}i) \sqrt[3]{\frac{79 - 3\sqrt{249}}{2}} \\
    \alpha_3
    &= - \frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{3}(1 + \sqrt{3}i) \sqrt[3]{\frac{2}{79 - 3\sqrt{249}}}
      + \frac{1}{6}(1 - \sqrt{3}i) \sqrt[3]{\frac{79 - 3\sqrt{249}}{2}}.
  \end{align*}
  So $f_*(x) = (x - \alpha_1)(x - \alpha_2)(x - \alpha_3)$.

\item[(3)]
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    f(x,y)
    =& \: (f_*)^{*} \\
    =& \: ((x - \alpha_1)(x - \alpha_2)(x - \alpha_3))^{*} \\
    =& \: (x - \alpha_1 y)(x - \alpha_2 y)(x - \alpha_3 y).
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Note.}
  If $f(x,y) = y^3 - 2xy^2 + 2x^2y + 4x^3$, then
  \[
    f(x,y) = (x - \alpha_1 y)(x - \alpha_2 y)(x - \alpha_3 y)

  where
  \begin{align*}
    \alpha_1

\emph{Suppose $f, g \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ are forms of degree $r$, $r + 1$ respectively,
with no common factors ($k$ a field). Show that $f+g$ is irreducible.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Suppose $f + g = rs \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.
  Proposition 5 implies that
  \[
    (f + g)^{*} = (rs)^{*}
    \Longrightarrow
    x_{n+1} f + g = r^{*} s^{*}.
  \]
  Note that $\deg_{x_{n+1}}(x_{n+1} f + g) = 1$.
  So $\deg_{x_{n+1}}(r^{*}) = 0$ or $\deg_{x_{n+1}}(s^{*}) = 0$.
  Might assume $\deg_{x_{n+1}}(r^{*}) = 0$. (The case $\deg_{x_{n+1}}(s^{*}) = 0$ is similar.)

\item[(2)]
  Since $\deg_{x_{n+1}}(r^{*}) = 0$, $r^{*} \mid f$ and $r^{*} \mid g$.
  Note that $\deg_{x_{n+1}}(r^{*}) = 0$ implies that $r^{*} = r$ is a form in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.
  Hence $r$ is a common factor of $f$ and $g$, or $r$ is a constant in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.
  So $f+g$ is irreducible.

\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  All monomials of degree $d$ in $R[x,y]$ are
  \[
    x^d, x^{d-1} y, \cdots, x y^{d-1}, y^d,
  \]
  or of the form $x^i y^j$ with $i, j \geq 0$ and $i + j = d$.
  So there are $d + 1$ monomials of degree $d$ in $R[x,y]$.

\item[(2)]
  Similar to (1), all monomials of degree $d$ in $R[x,y]$ are
  of the form $x^i y^j z^k$ with $i, j, k \geq 0$ and $i + j + k = d$.
  By the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_bars_%28combinatorics%29}

  monomials of degree $d$ in $R[x,y,z]$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  To show $V(d,n)$ is a vector space,
  it suffices to show that $V(d,n)$ is a subspace of $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
  since $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is a vector space over $k$.

\item[(2)]
  Note that $0 \in V(d,n)$ is nonempty.
  For any $f, g \in V(d,n)$ and $a, b \in k$, we have $af + bg \in V(d,n)$.
  Hence $V(d,n)$ is subspace.

\item[(3)]
  Let
  \[
    \mathscr{B}
    = \{ x_1^{i_1} \cdots x_n^{i_n}
      : i_1, \ldots, i_n \geq 0, i_1 + \cdots + i_n = d \}.
  \]
  $\mathscr{B}$ is an independent set, and $\mathscr{B}$ generates $V(d,n)$.
  So $\mathscr{B}$ is a basis for $V(d,n)$.

\item[(4)]
  Similar to (a),
  \[
    \dim_k V(d,n) = |\mathscr{B}| = {d+n-1 \choose n-1}
  \]
  by the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_bars_%28combinatorics%29}
  {stars and bars (combinatorics)} method.
  In particular,
  $\dim V(d,1) = 1$; $\dim V(d,2) = d+1$; $\dim V(d,3) = \frac{(d+1)(d+2)}{2}$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (c).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathscr{B}' := \{ A_{ij} : i+j=d \}$ is an independent set.}
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  Suppose that there were a nontrivial linear combination of $A_{ij}$ such that
  \[
    \sum_{i+j=d} c_{ij} A_{ij} = 0.
  \]

\item[(2)]
  Let $p$ be the smallest index $i$ such that $c_{ij} \neq 0$.
  Write $q := d - p$.
  So
  \begin{align*}
    & \: c_{pq} A_{pq}
    = -\sum_{\substack{i+j=d \\ i \neq p, j \neq q}} c_{ij} A_{ij}
    = -\sum_{\substack{i+j=d \\ i > p, j < q}} c_{ij} A_{ij} \\
    \Longleftrightarrow& \:
    A_{pq} = -\sum_{\substack{i+j=d \\ i > p, j < q}} \frac{c_{ij}}{c_{pq}} A_{ij} \\
    \Longleftrightarrow& \:
    \ell_1 \cdots \ell_p m_1 \cdots m_q
      = -\sum_{\substack{i+j=d \\ i > p, j < q}} \frac{c_{ij}}{c_{pq}}
        \ell_1 \cdots \ell_p \ell_{p+1} \cdots \ell_i m_1 \cdots m_j \\
    \Longleftrightarrow& \:
    m_1 \cdots m_q
      = - \ell_{p+1} \sum_{\substack{i+j=d \\ i > p, j < q}} \frac{c_{ij}}{c_{pq}}
        \underbrace{\ell_{p+2} \cdots \ell_i}_{:= 1 \text{ if } i = p+1} m_1 \cdots m_j \\
    \Longleftrightarrow& \:
    \ell_{p+1} \mid m_1 \cdots m_q.
  \end{align*}

  Since all $\ell_i, m_j$ are linear forms,
  $\ell_{p+1} \mid m_j$ for some $1 \leq j \leq q$,
  which is absurd since no $\ell_i = \lambda m_j$, $\lambda \in k$.
  Therefore, $\mathscr{B}'$ is an independent set.

\item[(3)]
  Since
  \[
    |\mathscr{B}'| = d+1 = \dim_{k} V(d,2),

  $\mathscr{B}'$ is also a basis for $V(d,2)$.

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  It suffices to show that $I^m + J^n = R$.

\item[(2)]
  Since $I^m + J^n \subseteq R$ is always true,
  it suffices to show that $I^m + J^n \supseteq R$.
  In fact,
  \begin{align*}
    R

\item[(5)]
  Note that $I_i^n$ and $I_j^n$ are comaximal if $i \neq j$ by (a).

    I_1^{n} \cdots I_N^{n} = I_1^{n} \cap \cdots \cap I_N^{n}.

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that if $\mathrm{rad}(I)$ is finitely generated,
  then for some integer $N$ we have $(\mathrm{rad}(I))^N \subseteq I$.}
  Say $x_1, \ldots, x_m \in \mathrm{rad}(I)$ generate $\mathrm{rad}(I)$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)]
    For each $i$, there exists an integer $n_i > 0$ such that $x_i^{n_i} \in I$
    (since $\mathrm{rad}(I)$ is radical).
    \item[(b)]
    Let $N = n_1 + \cdots + n_m$.
    Given any $x = \sum_{i=1}^{m} r_i x_i \in \mathrm{rad}(I)$,
    so
    \begin{align*}
      x^N
      &= \left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} r_i x_i \right)^{N} \\

    \end{align*}
    \item[(c)]
    Note that for each term there is some $j$ such that $k_j \geq n_j$.
    Hence,

  \item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that in a Noetherian ring the ideals $I$ and $J$ have the same radical
  iff there is some integer $N$ such that $I^N \subseteq J$ and $J^N \subseteq I$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)]
    $(\Longrightarrow)$
    Since in a Noetherian ring every ideal is finitely generated,
    $\mathrm{rad}(I)$ and $\mathrm{rad}(J)$ are finitely generated.
    By (1), there is a common integer $N$ such that
    \[
      (\mathrm{rad}(I))^N \subseteq I \:\: \text{ and } \:\:
      (\mathrm{rad}(J))^N \subseteq J.
    \]
    Note that $I^N \subseteq (\mathrm{rad}(I))^N$ and $J^N \subseteq (\mathrm{rad}(J))^N$.
    Since $\mathrm{rad}(I)$ = $\mathrm{rad}(J)$ by assumption,
    \begin{align*}
      I^N &\subseteq (\mathrm{rad}(I))^N = (\mathrm{rad}(J))^N \subseteq J, \\
      J^N &\subseteq (\mathrm{rad}(J))^N = (\mathrm{rad}(I))^N \subseteq I.
    \end{align*}
    \item[(b)]
    $(\Longleftarrow)$
    It suffices to show that $\mathrm{rad}(I) \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(J)$.
    $\mathrm{rad}(J) \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(I)$ is similar.
    Given any $x \in \mathrm{rad}(I)$, there is an integer $M > 0$ such that
    $x^M \in I$.
    Hence $x^{MN} \in I^N \subseteq J$, or $x \in \mathrm{rad}(J)$.

  \emph{Show that if $I, J \subseteq S = k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Define a map $\alpha: R/I \to R/J$ by $\alpha(r + I) = r + J$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $\alpha$ is well-defined.}
  If $a+I = b+I$,

    $\alpha(1+I) = 1+J$.

\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}

  $I$ is not necessary an ideal of $S$; $IS$ an ideal of $S$ (and thus $S/IS$ is well-defined).

\item[(2)]
  Define a map $\alpha: R/I \to S/IS$ by $\alpha(r + I) = r + IS$.
  Note that $I \subseteq IS$ as a subset in $S$.
  Apply the same argument in (a),
  $\alpha$ is well-defined

Let $J'$ be the image of $J$ in $\Gamma(V)$.
Show that there is a natural homomorphism $\varphi$ from

\emph{Proof.}

  It is well-defined since $\varphi(J \mathscr{O}_P(\mathbf{A}^{n})) = J' \mathscr{O}_P(V)$
  and $b(P) \neq 0$ implies that $\overline{b}(P) \neq 0$.

\item[(2)]
  Note that $V$ is a subvariety of $\mathbf{A}^{n}$.
  So $\varphi: \Gamma(\mathbf{A}^{n}) \to \Gamma(V)$ is a ring homomorphism by Problem 2.3

  by using the similar argument in Problem 2.21.

\item[(3)]
  $\varphi$ is surjective since
  $\mathscr{O}_P(\mathbf{A}^{n}) \hookrightarrow \mathscr{O}_P(V)$

  $\varphi$ is injective since $\varphi(J \mathscr{O}_P(\mathbf{A}^{n})) = J' \mathscr{O}_P(V)$.
  Hence $\varphi: \mathscr{O}_P(\mathbf{A}^{n})/J \to \mathscr{O}_P(\mathbf{A}^{n})$
  is isomorphic.
  In particular,
  $\mathscr{O}_P(\mathbf{A}^{n}) / I\mathscr{O}_P(\mathbf{A}^{n}) \cong \mathscr{O}_P(V)$

  As $a, b \in \mathrm{im}(\varphi)$,
  there are two elements $a', b' \in M$ such that $\varphi(a') = a$ and $\varphi(b') = b$.
  So $\varphi(a' - b') = \varphi(a') - \varphi(b') = a - b$,

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathrm{im}(\varphi)$ is a submodule of $M$.}
  By (3), it suffices to show that $ra \in \mathrm{im}(\varphi)$

  As $a \in \mathrm{im}(\varphi)$,
  there is one element $a' \in M$ such that $\varphi(a') = a$.

\item[(2)]
  By the rank-nullity theorem (Proposition 3),
  \begin{align*}
    \dim_k(\mathfrak{m}^{n}/\mathfrak{m}^{n+1})

$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $t$ be a uniformizing parameter for $R$, $z \in R$.
  By Problem 2.30(b), there are unique $\lambda_0, \ldots, \lambda_{n-1} \in k$
  and $z_{n-1} \in R$ such that
  \[
    z = \lambda_0 + \lambda_1 t + \cdots + \lambda_{n-1} t^{n-1} + z_{n-1} t^{n}.

  Hence we can define a map $\varphi: R/\mathfrak{m}^{n} \to k^n$
  by
  \[
    \varphi: z + \mathfrak{m}^{n} \mapsto (\lambda_0, \ldots, \lambda_{n-1}).

\item[(2)]
  $\varphi$ is well-defined by the uniqueness of the expression of $z$ in Problem 2.30(b).
  $\varphi$ is a $k$-module homomorphism and $\varphi$ is surjective (since $k \subseteq R$).
  $\varphi$ is injective by the uniqueness of the expression of $z$ in Problem 2.30(b).

\item[(3)]
  Hence, $R/\mathfrak{m}^{n} \cong k^n$ or $\dim_k(R/\mathfrak{m}^{n}) = n$ for $n > 0$.

  Since $(z) = (t^n) = \mathfrak{m}^{n}$, $\mathrm{ord}(z) = n$ by Problem 2.28.

\emph{Proof (Proposition 7 in \S 2.10).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  For $i = 0,\ldots,n$,
  by the rank-nullity theorem for a linear transformation
  $\varphi_{i}: V_{i} \to V_{i+1}$, we have
  \[
    \dim V_{i} = \dim \mathrm{im}(\varphi_{i}) + \dim \mathrm{ker}(\varphi_{i}).
  \]
  (Here $V_0 = V_{n+1} := 0$ by convention.)

\item[(2)]
  By the exactness of the sequence, we have
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    $\mathrm{im}(\varphi_{i}) = \mathrm{ker}(\varphi_{i+1})$ for $i = 0,\ldots, n-1$.

Every module is isomorphic to a quotient of a free module.} \\



\emph{Proof.}

\item[(1)]
  If $X$ generates $M$, then for any $m \in M$
  we can write

  the finite sum $\varphi := \sum_{x \in X} a_x \varphi_{x}$ to

$e = (x^2+y^2)^2 + 3x^2y - y^3$, and
$f = (x^2+y^2)^3 - 4x^2y^2$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial c}{\partial x} &= -3x^2 = 0 \\
    \frac{\partial c}{\partial y} &= 2y = 0
  \end{align*}
  implies that $(x,y) = (0,0)$.
  Note that
  $c(0,0) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial c}(0,0) = \frac{\partial c}{\partial y}(0,0) = 0$.
  So $(x,y) = (0,0)$ is the only multiple point on $c$.

\item[(2)]
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial d}{\partial x} &= -3x^2 - 2x = 0 \\
    \frac{\partial d}{\partial y} &= 2y = 0
  \end{align*}
  implies that $(x,y) = (0,0) \in d$ is the only multiple point on $d$.
  (Note that $(x,y) = \left( -\frac{2}{3},0 \right) \not\in d$.)

\item[(3)]
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial e}{\partial x} &= 4x(x^2+y^2) + 6xy = 0 \\
    \frac{\partial e}{\partial y} &= 4y(x^2+y^2) + 3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0
  \end{align*}
  implies that $x = 0$ or $4(x^2+y^2) + 6y = 0$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    $x = 0$ implies that $(x,y) = (0,0)$ or $(0,1)$.
    Note that $(0,1)$ is a simple point (since $\frac{\partial e}{\partial y}(0,1) = 1$).
  \item[(b)]
    $4(x^2+y^2) + 6y = 0$ implies that $x^2+y^2 = -\frac{3y}{2}$ and thus
    \begin{align*}
      0
      &= 4y(x^2+y^2) + 3x^2 - 3y^2 \\
      &= 4y\left( -\frac{3y}{2} \right) + 3x^2 - 3y^2 \\
      &= 3(x^2 - 3y^2).
    \end{align*}
    $(x,y) \in e$ implies that
    \begin{align*}
      0
      &= (x^2+y^2)^2 + 3x^2y - y^3 \\
      &= (3y^2+y^2)^2 + 3(3y^2)y - y^3 \\
      &= 8y^3(2y+1).
    \end{align*}
    So $(x,y) = (0,0)$ or $\left( \pm\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\frac{1}{2} \right)$.
    Note that $\frac{\partial e}{\partial x}\left( \pm\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\frac{1}{2} \right) \neq 0$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Therefore, $(x,y) = (0,0)$ is the only multiple point on $e$.

\item[(4)]
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} &= 6x(x^2+y^2)^2 - 8xy^2 = x(6(x^2+y^2)^2 - 8y^2) = 0 \\
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} &= 6y(x^2+y^2)^2 - 8x^2y = y(6(x^2+y^2)^2 - 8x^2) = 0
  \end{align*}
  implies that $(x,y) = (0,0)$
  or $6(x^2+y^2)^2 = 8x^2 = 8y^2$.
  $6(x^2+y^2)^2 = 8x^2 = 8y^2$ implies that $x^2 = y^2$.
  So $(x,y) \in f$ implies that $x^2 = y^2 = \frac{1}{2}$,
  contrary that $6 = 6(x^2+y^2)^2 \neq 8x^2 = 4$.
  Therefore, $(x,y) = (0,0)$ is the only multiple point on $f$.

\emph{Find the multiple points, and the tangent lines at the multiple points,
for each of the following curves:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{$y^3 - y^2 + x^3 - x^2 + 3xy^2 + 3x^2y + 2xy$.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{$x^4 + y^4 - x^2y^2$.}

\end{enumerate}
\emph{Sketch the part of the curve in (d)
that is contained in $\mathbf{A}^{2}(\mathbb{R}) \subseteq \mathbf{A}^{2}(\mathbb{C})$.} \\



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $f = y^3 - y^2 + x^3 - x^2 + 3xy^2 + 3x^2y + 2xy \in k[x,y]$.
  So
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} &= 3x^2 + 6xy + 3y^2 - 2x + 2y = 0 \\
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} &= 3x^2 + 6xy + 3y^2 + 2x - 2y = 0
  \end{align*}
  implies that
  \begin{align*}
    6(x+y)^2 &= 0 \\
    -4(x - y) &= 0
  \end{align*}
  Note that
  $f(0,0) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(0,0) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(0,0) = 0$.
  Hence, $(x,y) = (0,0)$ is the only multiple point on $f$.

\item[(2)]
  Write $f = (y^3 + 3xy^2 + 3x^2y + x^3) + (-x^2 + 2xy - y^2)$.
  The tangent lines at $(x,y) = (0,0)$ is the linear factors of
  $-x^2 + 2xy - y^2 = -(x-y)^2$.
  Hence, the line $x - y = 0$ is the only tangent line at $(x,y) = (0,0)$
  of the multiplicity $= 2$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $f = x^4 + y^4 - x^2y^2 \in k[x,y]$.
  So
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} &= 4x^3 - 2xy^2 = 0 \\
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} &= 4y^3 - 2x^2y = 0
  \end{align*}
  implies that $(x,y) = (0,0)$.
  Note that
  $f(0,0) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(0,0) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(0,0) = 0$.
  Hence, $(x,y) = (0,0)$ is the only multiple point on $f$.

\item[(2)]
  The tangent lines at $(x,y) = (0,0)$ is the linear factors of
  $x^4 + y^4 - x^2y^2$.
  Hence, there are four distinct tangent lines
  \[
    x \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2}} y
  \]
  at $(x,y) = (0,0)$.
  Each tangent line is simple.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (c).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $f = x^3 + y^3 - 3x^2 - 3y^2 + 3xy + 1 \in k[x,y]$.
  So
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} &= 3(x^2 - 2x + y) = 0 \\
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} &= 3(y^2 - 2y + x) = 0
  \end{align*}
  implies that $(x-y)(x+y-3) = 0$.

\item[(2)]
  The case $x-y = 0$. Take $x = y$ in $3x^2 - 6x + 3y = 0$ to get
  $(x,y) = (1,1), (0,0)$.
  $(x,y) = (1,1)$ is a multiple point on $f$ since
  $f(1,1) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(1,1) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(1,1) = 0$.
  $(x,y) = (0,0)$ is impossible since $f(0,0) = 1 \neq 0$.

\item[(3)]
  The case $x+y-3 = 0$. Take $x = -y + 3$ in $f$ to get $1 = 0$, which is absurd.

\item[(4)]
  By (2)(3), the only multiple point on $f$ is $(x,y) = (1,1)$.

\item[(5)]
  Let $t(x,y) = (x+1,y+1)$.
  Then
  \[
    f^{t} = f(x+1,y+1) = x^3 + y^3 + 3xy.
  \]
  The tangent lines at $(x,y) = (1,1)$ is the linear factors of
  $x^3 + y^3 + 3xy$.
  Hence, there are two distinct simple tangent lines $x$ and $y$ at $(x,y) = (1,1)$.
  \end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (d).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $f = y^2 + (x^2 - 5)(4x^4 - 20x^2 + 25) \in k[x,y]$.
  So
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} &= 2x(2x^2-5)(6x^2-25) = 0 \\
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} &= 2y = 0
  \end{align*}
  implies that there are only two multiple points
  \[
    (x,y) = \left( \pm\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}, 0 \right)
  \]
  on $f$.

\item[(2)]
  Let $t(x,y) = \left( x + \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}, y \right)$.
  Then
  \begin{align*}
    f^{t}
    &= f\left( x + \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}, y \right) \\
    &= 4 x^6 + 12\sqrt{10} x^5 + 110 x^4 + 20\sqrt{10} x^3 - 100 x^2 + y^2.
  \end{align*}
  The tangent lines at $(x,y) = \left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}, 0 \right)$ is the linear factors of
  $-100 x^2 + y^2 = -(10x+y)(10x-y)$.
  Hence, there are two distinct simple tangent lines
  \[
    10x \pm y
  \]
  at $(x,y) = \left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}, 0 \right)$.

\item[(3)]
  Similarly, there are also two distinct simple tangent lines
  \[
    10x \pm y
  \]
  at $(x,y) = \left( -\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}, 0 \right)$.
  \end{enumerate}

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Might assume that $P = (0,0)$.
  (Note that any translation of $f$ preserves the degree of $f$.)

\item[(2)]
  Write
  \[
    f = f_m + f_{m+1} + \cdots + f_n
  \]
  where $f_i$ is a form in $k[x,y]$.
  Since $m$ is the multiplicity of $f$ at $P$, $m = n$.

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Might assume that $P = (0,0)$ is a double point on $f$.
  Write
  \[
    f = f_2 + f_3 + \cdots + f_n \in k[x,y]
  \]
  (where $f_i$ is a form in $k[x,y]$),
  and

    f_2 = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 \in k[x,y].
  \]

\item[(2)]
  $P$ is a node if and only if the discriminant
  \[

Find an explicit description for the leading form for $f$ at $P$ in
terms of these derivatives.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Might assume that $P = (0,0)$.
  Write $f = f_0 + f_1 + \cdots + f_n$ where $f_i$ is a form in $k[x,y]$.
  Consider any form $f_m$ of $f$.
  Write
  \[
    f_m = c_{m} x^m + c_{m-1} x^{m-1} y + \cdots + c_{0} y^m
  \]
  where $c_i \in k$ and not all $c_i$ are zero.

\item[(2)]
  Similar to Problem 3.4,
  $\frac{\partial^{m} f}{\partial x^i \partial y^j}(P) = c_i i!j!$.
  Here $i+j = m$.
  Hence,
  \[
    c_i
    = \frac{1}{i!j!} \frac{\partial^{m} f}{\partial x^i \partial y^j}(P)
    = \frac{1}{m!} {m \choose i} \frac{\partial^{m} f}{\partial x^i \partial y^j}(P)
  \]
  and thus
  \[
    f_m
    = \frac{1}{m!} \sum_{i = 0}^{m}
    {m \choose i} \frac{\partial^{m} f}{\partial x^i \partial y^j}(P) x^i y^j.
  \]

\item[(3)]
  Suppose $m$ is the smallest integer such that
  for some $i + j = m$,
  \[
    \frac{\partial^{m} f}{\partial x^i \partial y^j}(P) \neq 0.

  Then $f_0 = f_1 = \cdots = f_{m-1} = 0$ and $f_m \neq 0$ in $k[x,y]$ by (2).
  Therefore, $m = m_P(f)$.
  The explicit description for the leading form $f_m$ for $f$ at $P$

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $f_m = \prod \ell_i^{r_i} \in k[x,y]$.
  Problem 1.4 implies that there exists a point $P = (a,b)$ such that

  Since $(a,b) \neq (0,0)$, $\deg(\ell) = 1$.

  (Hint: Make the polynomials homogeneous with respect to a variable $z$, and use \S 2.6.)} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  De Moivre's theorem implies that
  \begin{align*}
    \cos(n\theta)+i \sin(n\theta)
    =& \: (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)^n \\
    =& \: \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} (\cos\theta)^{n-k} i^{k} (\sin\theta)^{k} \\
    =& \: \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}
      (-1)^k {n \choose 2k} (\cos\theta)^{n-2k} (\sin\theta)^{2k} \\
      &+ i \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor \frac{n-1}{2} \rfloor}
      (-1)^k {n \choose 2k+1} (\cos\theta)^{n-2k-1} (\sin\theta)^{2k+1}.
  \end{align*}
  Hence,
  \[
    \sin(n\theta)
    = \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor \frac{n-1}{2} \rfloor}
      (-1)^k {n \choose 2k+1} (\cos\theta)^{n-2k-1} (\sin\theta)^{2k+1}.
  \]
  In particular,
  \[
    \sin(3\theta)
    = 3 \cos^{2}\theta \sin\theta - \sin^{3}\theta.
  \]

\item[(2)]
  $r = -\sin(3\theta)$ implies that
  \begin{align*}
    r^4
    &= r^3(-\sin(3\theta)) \\
    &= r^3 (-3 \cos^{2}\theta \sin\theta + \sin^{3}\theta) \\
    &= -3 (r\cos\theta)^2 (r\sin\theta) + (r\sin\theta)^3.
  \end{align*}
  Hence, $r = -\sin(3\theta)$ implies that
  \[
    (x^2+y^2)^2 = -3x^2 y + y^3
  \]
  in $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.

\item[(3)]
  As $f(x,y) = (x^2+y^2)^3 - 4x^2y^2$,
  $f(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta) = 0$ implies that
  \[
    r^6
    = 4r^4 \cos^2\theta\sin^2\theta
    = r^4 \sin^2 2\theta
  \]
  or
  \[
    r^2 = \sin^2 2\theta.
  \]
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  By (a), $r = \sin(n\theta)$ with odd $n \geq 1$
  implies that
  \begin{align*}
    & \: r
    = \sin(n\theta)
    = \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{n-1}{2}}
      (-1)^k {n \choose 2k+1} (\cos\theta)^{n-2k-1} (\sin\theta)^{2k+1} \\
    \Longrightarrow& \:
    r^{n+1}
    = \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{n-1}{2}}
      (-1)^k {n \choose 2k+1} (r\cos\theta)^{n-2k-1} (r\sin\theta)^{2k+1} \\
    \Longrightarrow& \:
    (x^2+y^2)^{\frac{n+1}{2}}
    = \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{n-1}{2}}
      (-1)^k {n \choose 2k+1} x^{n-2k-1} y^{2k+1}.
  \end{align*}
  Hence, $r = \sin(n\theta)$ defines the real part of a curve
  \[
    \alpha: (x^2+y^2)^{\frac{n+1}{2}}
    - \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{n-1}{2}}
      (-1)^k {n \choose 2k+1} x^{n-2k-1} y^{2k+1}
  \]
  of degree $n+1$.

\item[(2)]
  Note that $(0,0) \in \alpha$.
  Since
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial x}
    =& \:
    (n+1)(x^2+y^2)^{\frac{n-1}{2}}x \\
    &- \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{n-3}{2}}
      (-1)^k (n-2k-1) {n \choose 2k+1} x^{n-2k-2} y^{2k+1} \\
    \frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial y}
    =& \:
    (n+1)(x^2+y^2)^{\frac{n-1}{2}}y \\
    &- \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{n-1}{2}}
      (-1)^k (2k+1) {n \choose 2k+1} x^{n-2k-1} y^{2k},
  \end{align*}
  $\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial x}(0,0) = \frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial y}(0,0) = 0$.
  $(0,0)$ is a multiple point.

\item[(3)]
  The tangents at $(0,0)$ are the linear factors of
  \[
    \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{n-1}{2}} (-1)^k {n \choose 2k+1} x^{n-2k-1} y^{2k+1}.
  \]
  Clearly, $y$ is a tangent line at $(0,0)$.
  Note that rotation by $\frac{\pi}{n}$ is a linear transformation that takes the curve into itself.
  Hence, all tangents at $(0,0)$ are
  \[
    \ell_k: \sin\frac{k\pi}{n} x - \cos\frac{k\pi}{n} y
  \]
  for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1$.
  All $\ell_k$ are pairwise distinct, and thus $(0,0)$ is an ordinary $n$-tuple point.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (c).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Similar to (b),
  $r^2 = \sin^2(n\theta)$ defines the real part of a curve
  \[
    \beta: (x^2+y^2)^{n+1}
    - \left( \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{n-2}{2}} (-1)^k {n \choose 2k+1} x^{n-2k-1} y^{2k+1} \right)^2
  \]
  of degree $2n+2$.

\item[(2)]
  Note that
  \[
    \beta(0,0)
    = \frac{\partial \beta}{\partial x}(0,0)
    = \frac{\partial \beta}{\partial y}(0,0)
    = 0.
  \]
  Hence, $(0,0)$ is a multiple point.

\item[(3)]
  Similar to (b), all tangents at $(0,0)$ are
  \[
    \ell_k: \sin\frac{k\pi}{n} x - \cos\frac{k\pi}{n} y
  \]
  of multiplicity $= 2$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1$.

  The case $n$ is odd.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]

    \end{align*}
    (with some $c \in \mathbb{C}$),
    $\alpha_{n+1}$ and $\alpha_{n}$ have no common factors in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$.
    By Problem 2.34, $\alpha$ is irreducible.

  The case $n$ is even.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    Consider
    \[
      \beta: \underbrace{(x^2+y^2)^{n+1}}_{:= \beta_{2n+2}}
      \underbrace{-\left( \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{n-2}{2}}
        (-1)^k {n \choose 2k+1} x^{n-2k-1} y^{2k+1} \right)^2}_{:= \beta_{2n}}.
    \]

  \item[(b)]
    Similar to the proof of Problem 2.34,
    suppose $\beta = \beta_{2n} + \beta_{2n+2} = rs \in \mathbb{C}[x,y]$.
    So
    \[
      (\beta_{2n} + \beta_{2n+2})^{*} = (rs)^{*}
      \Longrightarrow
      z^2 \beta_{2n} + \beta_{2n+2} = r^{*} s^{*}.
    \]
    Note that $\deg_{z}(z^2 \beta_{2n} + \beta_{2n+2}) = 2$.
    So $\deg_{z}(r^{*}) = 0, 1, 2$.

  \item[(c)]
    The case $\deg_{z}(r^{*}) = 0, 2$ is similar to the proof of Problem 2.34
    because $\beta_{2n}$ and $\beta_{2n+2}$ have no common factors in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$.

  \item[(d)]
    The case $\deg_{z}(r^{*}) = 1$. (So $\deg_{z}(s^{*}) = 1$.)
    Write $r = r_p + r_{p+1}$ and $s = s_q + s_{q+1}$.
    Hence, $\beta = rs$ implies that
    \begin{align*}
      r_p s_q
      &= -\left( \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{n-2}{2}}
        (-1)^k {n \choose 2k+1} x^{n-2k-1} y^{2k+1} \right)^2 \\
      r_p s_{q+1} + r_{p+1}s_q
      &= 0 \\
      r_{p+1} s_{q+1}
      &= (x^2+y^2)^{n+1} = (x+iy)^{n+1}(x-iy)^{n+1}.
    \end{align*}
    Since $n+1$ is odd and
    $x \pm iy \nmid
    -\left( \sum_{k=0}^{\frac{n-2}{2}} (-1)^k {n \choose 2k+1} x^{n-2k-1} y^{2k+1} \right)^2$,
    $r_p s_{q+1} + r_{p+1}s_q = 0$ implies that $r_p = s_q = 0$, which is absurd.

  \item[(e)]
    By (b)(c)(d), $\beta$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{C}$.

  Show that $m_Q(f^t) = m_P(f)$ if $J_Qt$ is invertible.}

  \emph{Show that the converse of (b) is false:
  let $t = (x^2, y)$, $f = y - x^2$, $P = Q = (0, 0)$.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Might assume that $P = Q = (0, 0)$.
  Write $t = (t_1, t_2)$ and thus $(0,0) = t(0,0) = (t_1(0,0), t_2(0,0))$.
  So there is no nonzero constant term in $t_i$ ($i = 1, 2$).

\item[(2)]
  Might assume that $f \neq 0$ (since there is nothing to prove when $f = 0$).
  Write $f = f_m + f_{m+1} + \cdots + f_n$ where $f_i$ is a form in $k[x,y]$
  and $f_m \neq 0$.
  So,
  \[
    f(t_1(x,y),t_2(x,y))
    = f_m(t_1(x,y),t_2(x,y)) + \cdots + f_n(t_1(x,y),t_2(x,y))
  \]
  has the multiplicity $= \infty$ or $\geq m = m_P(f)$.
  In any case, $m_Q(f^t) \geq m_P(f)$.

\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Might assume that $P = Q = (0, 0)$.
  Since $J_Qt$ is invertible,
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \frac{\partial t_1}{\partial x}(Q) & \frac{\partial t_1}{\partial y}(Q)
    \end{bmatrix}

    &\neq 0

  (as vectors).
  Hence $t_1$ (resp. $t_2$) has the multiplicity $= 1$.

\item[(2)]
  Define
  \[
    s = (s_1, s_2): \mathbf{A}^2 \to \mathbf{A}^2
  \] be a polynomial map such that $s_i$ is the linear term of $t_i$.
  Note that $J_Q{s} = J_Q{t}$ is invertible and $m_Q(f^s) = m_Q(f^t)$ for any $f$.

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $m_Q(f^s) = m_Q(f^t)$ for any $f \in k[x,y]$.}
  Might assume that $f \neq 0$ (since there is nothing to prove when $f = 0$).
  Write $f = f_m + f_{m+1} + \cdots + f_n$ where $f_i$ is a form in $k[x,y]$
  and $f_m \neq 0$.
  Since
  \[
    m_{Q}(f_i^t) = m_{Q}(f_i^s) = i \text{ or } \infty,
  \]
  $m_Q(f^s) = m_Q(f^t)$.

\item[(4)]
  Since $J_Q{s}$ is invertible,
  $s^{-1}$ is also a polynomial map with an invertible Jacobian matrix $J_Q{s^{-1}}$.
  By (a),
  \[
    m_Q(f^s) \geq m_P(f) = m_P((f^s)^{s^{-1}}) = m_Q(f^s)
  \]
  or $m_Q(f^s) = m_P(f)$.
  Therefore, $m_Q(f^t) = m_Q(f^s) = m_P(f)$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (c).}
  $m_P(f) = 1$ and $m_Q(f^t) = 1$ since $f^t = y - x^4$.
  However,
  \[
    J_Q{t}
    =

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $P = (0,\ldots,0)$.
  Write $f = f_m + f_{m+1} + \cdots + f_n$,
  where $f_i$ is a form in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ of degree $i$, $f_m \neq 0$.
  We define $m$ to be the multiplicity of $f$ at $P = (0,\ldots,0)$, write $m = m_P(f)$.

\item[(2)]
  To extend these definitions to a point $P = (a_1,\ldots,a_n) \neq (0,\ldots,0)$,
  let $t$ be the translation that takes $(0,\ldots,0)$ to $P$, i.e.,
  \[
    t(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = (x_1+a_1,\ldots,x_n+a_n).

  If $m = 1$, then $f_m = f_1$ is a hyperplane.
  Hence, we can define the tangent hyperplane to $f$ at $P$ to be $f_1$.

\item[(2)]
  Similar to (a),
  the tangent hyperplane to $f$ at $P = (a_1,\ldots,a_n) \neq (0,\ldots,0)$ is $g_1$
  where
  \[
    f^t = g_1 + g_2 + \cdots

  No.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ is irreducible over $k$.}
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  Suppose $x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ were reducible.
  By Problem 1.1, we can write
  \[
    x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = (a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 z)(b_1 x + b_2 y + b_3 z)
  \]
  for some $a_i, b_i \in k$ ($i = 1, 2, 3$).
  Expanding out the right hand side and comparing coefficients to get
  \begin{align*}
    & a_1 b_1 = a_2 b_2 = -a_3 b_3 = 1 \\
    & a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1 = a_2 b_3 + a_3 b_2 = a_3 b_1 + a_1 b_3 = 0.
  \end{align*}
  So $a_i, b_i \neq 0$ for all $i$ and
  \[
    b_1
    = \frac{-a_1}{a_3} b_3
    = \frac{-a_1}{a_3} \cdot \frac{-a_3}{a_2} b_2
    = \frac{-a_1}{a_3} \cdot \frac{-a_3}{a_2} \cdot \frac{-a_2}{a_1} b_1 = -b_1.

  Hence, $b_1 = 0$, which is absurd.

\item[(3)]
  Since $x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ is irreducible over any field $k$ with $\mathrm{char}(k) = 0$,
  it is impossible to define tangent hyperplanes at $(0,0,0)$.

  Let

  Moreover, $V$ is an algebraic set.

\item[(2)]
  Since $f$ is irreducible and $\deg\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \right) = \deg f - 1$,
  $f$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ have no common factors.
  By Proposition 2 in \S 1.6,

  Give a simple criterion for calculating $\mathrm{ord}^{f}_P(y)$,
  and therefore for determining if $P$ is a higher flex.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  When $n = 0$ or $1$, the tangent line $L$ to $f$ at any point is $L = f$ itself.
  So
  \[
    \mathrm{ord}^{f}_P(L)
    = \mathrm{ord}^{f}_P(f)
    = \mathrm{ord}^{f}_P(0)
    = \infty.
  \]
  $P$ is a higher flex.

\item[(2)]
  When $n > 1$, the tangent line $L$ to $f$ at $P = (0,0)$ is $L = y$.
  So
  \[
    \mathrm{ord}^{f}_P(L)
    = \mathrm{ord}^{f}_P(y)
    = \mathrm{ord}^{f}_P(x^n)
    = n.
  \]
  Here $x$ is a uniformizing parameter for $\mathscr{O}_P(f)$
  since the line $x$ is not tangent to $f$ (Theorem 1).
  Hence, $P$ is a flex if $n \geq 3$,
  $P$ is an ordinary flex if $n = 3$, and
  $P$ is a higher flex if $n > 3$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Since $y$ is the tangent line, $\mathrm{ord}^{f}_P(y) \geq 2$.
  By Problem 2.29(a),
  \[
    \mathrm{ord}^{f}_P(y)
    = \mathrm{ord}^{f}_P(ax^2 + \cdots)
    = 2
  \]
  if and only if $a \neq 0$.
  Hence, $P$ is flex iff $\mathrm{ord}^{f}_P(y) \geq 3$ iff $a = 0$.

\item[(2)]
  In general,
  \[
    \mathrm{ord}^{f}_P(y)
    = \mathrm{ord}^{f}_P(ax^2 + \cdots)
    = m_P(ax^2 + \cdots)
    = m_P(f - y).

In particular, $P$ is a simple point if and only if $\dim_k(\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2) = 1$;
otherwise $\dim_k(\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2) = 2$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  From the exact sequence
  \[
    0

    \to \mathscr{O}/\mathfrak{m}^{n+1}
    \to \mathscr{O}/\mathfrak{m}^{n}

    0,
  \]
  it suffices to show that
  \[
    \dim_k(\mathscr{O}/\mathfrak{m}^{n}) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
  \]
  as $0 \leq n < m_P(f)$. (Problem 2.49 and Proposition 7 in \S 2.10.)

\item[(2)]
  We may assume that $P = (0,0)$. Similar to the proof of Theorem 2,
  we are reduced to calculating the dimension of $k[x,y]/(I^n,f)$.
  Let $m = m_P(f)$.
  By the definition of $m$,
  \[
    f \in {\underbrace{(x,y)}_{= I }}^{m} = I^{m}.
  \]
  So if $0 \leq n < m_P(f)$, then $f \in I^{m} \subseteq I^n$ and thus $(I^n,f) = I^n$.
  Therefore,
  \begin{align*}
    \dim_k(\mathscr{O}/\mathfrak{m}^{n})
    &= \dim_k(k[x,y]/(I^n,f)) \\
    &= \dim_k(k[x,y]/I^n) \\
    &= \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.
      &(\text{Problem 2.46})
  \end{align*}
  So
  \[
    \dim_k(\mathfrak{m}^n/\mathfrak{m}^{n+1})
    = \dim_k(\mathscr{O}/\mathfrak{m}^{n+1}) - \dim_k(\mathscr{O}/\mathfrak{m}^{n})
    = n + 1.
  \]

\item[(3)]
  $P$ is a simple point if $m = m_P(f) = 1$ by definition.
  Note that
  \begin{equation*}
    \dim_k(\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2) =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if $m = 1$ (Theorem 1)} \\
      2 & \text{if $m > 1$ ((2))}. \\
    \end{cases}

  $P$ is a simple iff $m = 1$ iff $\dim_k(\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2) = 1$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Let $\mathscr{O} = \mathscr{O}_P(\mathbf{A}^2)$ for some $P \in \mathbf{A}^2$,
  $\mathfrak{m} = \mathfrak{m}_P(\mathbf{A}^2)$.

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Let $\mathscr{O} = \mathscr{O}_P(\mathbf{A}^r(k))$.
  Show that $\chi(n)$ is a polynomial of degree $r$ in $n$,

\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
  Might assume that $P = (0,0)$.
  By Problem 2.46, the Hilbert-Samuel polynomial is
  \[
    \chi(n)
    = \dim_k(\mathscr{O}/\mathfrak{m}^n)
    = \dim_k(k[x,y]/(x,y)^n)
    = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.
  \]
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Might assume that $P = (0, \ldots, 0)$.
  Similar to (a),
  \[
    \chi(n)
    = \dim_k(\mathscr{O}/\mathfrak{m}^n)
    = \dim_k(k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]/(x_1,\ldots,x_r)^n).
  \]

\item[(2)]
  Since
  \[
    \mathscr{B}
    = \{ x_1^{i_1} x_2^{i_2} \cdots x_r^{i_r} : i_1 + \cdots + i_r < n \}
  \]
  is a basis for $k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]/(x_1,\ldots,x_r)^n$,
  \[
    \dim_k(k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]/(x_1,\ldots,x_r)^n) = \abs{ \mathscr{B} }.
  \]

\item[(3)]
  By the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_bars_%28combinatorics%29}
  {stars and bars (combinatorics)} method (as Problem 2.35(b)),
  \begin{align*}
    \abs{ \mathscr{B} }
    =& \: \abs{ \{ (i_1, \ldots i_r) : i_1 + \cdots + i_r \leq n \} } \\
      & \: - \abs{ \{ (i_1, \ldots i_r) : i_1 + \cdots + i_r = n \} } \\
    =& \: \abs{ \{ (i_1, \ldots i_r, j) : i_1 + \cdots + i_r + j = n \} } \\
      & \: - \abs{ \{ (i_1, \ldots i_r) : i_1 + \cdots + i_r = n \} } \\
    =& \: { n+r \choose r } - { n+r-1 \choose r-1 } \\
    =& \: { n+r-1 \choose r } \\
    =& \: \frac{1}{r!} (n+r-1)(n+r-2) \cdots (n+1)(n).
  \end{align*}
  So
  \[
    \chi(n)
    = \frac{1}{r!} (n+r-1)(n+r-2) \cdots (n+1)(n)
  \]
  is a polynomial of degree $r$ in $n$, with leading coefficient $\frac{1}{r!}$.

\item[(4)]
  By Problem 2.36, we can also deduce that
  \begin{align*}
    \dim_k(k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]/(x_1,\ldots,x_r)^n)
    &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \dim_k V(i,r) \\
    &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} { i+r-1 \choose r-1 } \\
    &= { n+r-1 \choose r }

\emph{Let $f \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]$ define a hypersurface in $\mathbf{A}^r$.
Write $f = f_m + f_{m+1} + \cdots$,
and let $m = m_P(f)$ where $P = (0, \ldots, 0)$.
Suppose $f$ is irreducible,
and let $\mathscr{O} = \mathscr{O}_P(V(f))$,
$\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal.
Show that $\chi(n) = \dim_k(\mathscr{O}/\mathfrak{m}^n)$ is a polynomial of degree $r-1$
for sufficiently large $n$,
and that the leading coefficient of $\chi$ is $\frac{m_P(f)}{(r-1)!}$.
Can you find a definition for the multiplicity of a local ring
that makes sense in all the cases you know?} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Similar to the proof of Theorem 2.
  By Problem 2.43,
  \[
    \mathfrak{m}^n = I^n \mathscr{O}
  \]
  where $I = (x_1, \ldots, x_r) \subseteq k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]$.
  Since $V(I^n) = \{P\}$,
  \[
    k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]/(I^n,f)
    \cong
    \mathscr{O}_P(\mathbf{A}^r)/(I^n,f)\mathscr{O}_P(\mathbf{A}^r)
    \cong
    \mathscr{O}/I^n \mathscr{O}
    \cong
    \mathscr{O}/\mathfrak{m}^n
  \]
  (Corollary 2 to Proposition 6 in \S 2.9 and Problem 2.44).

\item[(2)]
  So we are reduced to calculating the dimension of $k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]/(I^n,f)$.
  As $n \geq m = m_P(f)$,
  there is a natural ring homomorphism
  \[
    \varphi: k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]/I^n \to k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]/(I^n,f)
  \]
  and a $k$-linear map
  \[
    \psi: k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]/I^{n-m} \to k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]/I^n
  \]
  defined by $\overline{g} \mapsto \overline{fg}$.
  It is easy to verify that the sequence
  \[
    0
    \to k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]/I^{n-m}
    \xrightarrow{\psi} k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]/I^{n}
    \xrightarrow{\varphi} k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]/(I^{n},f)
    \to 0
  \]
  is exact.

\item[(3)]
  By Problem 3.15,
  \begin{align*}
    & \: \dim_k(k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]/(I^{n},f)) \\
    =& \:
    {n+r-1 \choose r} - {n-m+r-1 \choose r} \\
    =& \:
    \frac{1}{r!} \left( (n+r-1) \cdots n - (n-m+r-1) \cdots (n-m) \right) \\
    =& \:
    \frac{1}{r!} \left( n^{r-1}(rm) + \cdots \right) \\
    =& \:
    \frac{m}{(r-1)!} n^{r-1} + \cdots.
  \end{align*}
  Therefore, $\chi(n) = \dim_k(\mathscr{O}/\mathfrak{m}^n)$ is a polynomial of degree $r-1$
  for $n \geq m$,
  and that the leading coefficient of $\chi$ is $\frac{m_P(f)}{(r-1)!}$.

\item[(4)]
  It is reasonable to define the multiplicity of a Noetherian local ring $\mathscr{O}$ by
  \[
    (d!) \cdot (\text{leading coefficient of } \chi(n))
  \]
  for sufficiently large $n$,
  where $d$ is the dimension (or Krull dimension) of $\mathscr{O}$.
  (Note that the dimension of a hypersurface in $\mathbf{A}^r$ is $r-1$.)

\subsubsection*{Problem 3.18.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 3.18.}
\emph{Give a proof of Property (8) that uses only Properties (1)-(7).} \\



Recall Properties (1)-(8):
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $I(P, f \cap g)$ is a nonnegative integer for any $f$, $g$,
  and $P$ such that $f$ and $g$ intersect properly at $P$.
  $I(P, f \cap g) = \infty$ if $f$ and $g$ do not intersect properly at $P$.

\item[(2)]
  $I(P, f \cap g) = 0$ if and only if $P \not\in f \cap g$.
  $I(P, f \cap g)$ depends only on the components of $f$ and $g$ that pass through $P$.

\item[(3)]
  If $t$ is an affine change of coordinates on $\mathbf{A}^2$,
  and $t(Q) = P$, then
  \[
    I(P, f \cap g) = I(Q, f^t \cap g^t).
  \]

\item[(4)]
  $I(P, f \cap g) = I(P, g \cap f)$.

\item[(5)]
  $I(P, f \cap g) \geq m_P(f) m_P(g)$,
  with equality occurring if and only if $f$ and $g$ have not tangent lines in common at $P$.

\item[(6)]
  If $f = \prod f_i^{r_i}$, and $g = \prod g_j^{s_j}$, then
  \[
    I(P, f \cap g) = \sum_{i, j} r_i s_j I(P, f_i \cap g_j).
  \]

\item[(7)]
  $I(P, f \cap g) = I(P, f \cap (g+af))$ for any $a \in k[x,y]$.

\item[(8)]
  If $P$ is a simple point on $f$, then $I(P, f \cap g) = \mathrm{ord}_P^{f}(g)$. \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Might assume that $f$ is irreducible.
  There is nothing to prove if $\mathrm{ord}_P^{f}(g) = \infty$.
  Might assume that $n = \mathrm{ord}_P^{f}(g) < \infty$.

\item[(2)]
  Similar to the proof of Theorem 1 in \S 3.2,
  Property (3) implies that we might assume that $P = (0,0)$,
  that $y$ is the tangent line,
  and that $x$ is one line through $P$ which is not tangent to $f$ at $P$.
  Here $x$ is a uniformizing parameter for $\mathscr{O}_P(f)$ (Theorem 1 in \S 3.2).

\item[(3)]
  By definition,
  \[
    g = ux^n
  \]
  for some unit in $\mathscr{O}_P(f)$.
  Write $u = \frac{a}{b}$ where $a, b \in k[x,y]$, $a(P) \neq 0$ and $b(P) \neq 0$.
  Hence,
  \[
    bg = ax^n + cf
  \]
  in $k[x,y]$ for some $c \in k[x,y]$.

\item[(4)]
  Therefore,
  \begin{align*}
    I(P, f \cap g)
    &= I(P, f \cap bg) - I(P, f \cap b)
      &(\text{Property (6)}) \\

\emph{Suppose $P$ is a double point on a curve $f$,

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that $I(P, f \cap L) \geq 3$.
  The curve $f$ is said to have an (ordinary) \textbf{cusp} at $P$ if $I(P, f \cap L) = 3$.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Suppose $P = (0,0)$, and $L = y$.
  Show that $P$ is a cusp if and only if
  $\frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial x^3}(P) \neq 0$. Give some examples.}

\item[(c)]
  \emph{Show that if $P$ is a cusp on $f$,
  then $f$ has only one component passing through $P$.} \\
\end{enumerate}



Might assume that $\mathrm{char}(k) = 0$. \\



\emph{Proof of (a).}
  Since $I(P, f \cap L) > m_P(f) = 2$ (Problem 3.19),
  $I(P, f \cap L) \geq 3$ (Property (1)).
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  By assumption,
  \[
    f = y^2 + f_3 + f_4 + \cdots
  \]
  where $f_i$ is a form in $k[x,y]$.

\item[(2)]
  Hence, $P$ is a cusp of $f$
  if and only if
  \begin{align*}
    3
    &= I(P, f \cap y) \\
    &= I(P, (y^2 + f_3 + f_4 + \cdots) \cap y) \\

    &\geq m_P(f_3 + f_4 + \cdots) m_P(y) \\
    &\geq 3.
  \end{align*}
  Here the equality is occuring if and only if
  $y$ is not a tangent line of $f_3 + f_4 + \cdots$ (Property (5)).

\item[(3)]
  Note that
  \begin{align*}
    & \: \text{$y$ is not a tangent line of $f_3 + f_4 + \cdots$} \\
    \Longleftrightarrow & \:
    y \nmid f_3 \\
    \Longleftrightarrow & \:
    \frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial x^3}(P) \neq 0.
      &(\text{Problem 3.5})
  \end{align*}

\item[(4)]
  Examples: $y^2 = x^3$, $y^2 = -x^2 y^2 + x^3$ and so on.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (c).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Might assume $P = (0,0)$ and $L = y$ by Property (3).

\item[(2)]
  Given $f = gh$.
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    f &= y^2 + \text{higher terms} \\
    g &= g_r + \text{higher terms} \\
    h &= h_s + \text{higher terms}
  \end{align*}
  where $g_r$ (resp. $h_s$) is a form of degree $r$ (resp. $s$) in $k[x,y]$.
  So $f = gh$ implies that
  \begin{align*}
    y^2 + \text{higher terms}
    &= (g_r + \text{higher terms})(h_s + \text{higher terms}) \\
    &= (g_r h_s) + \text{higher terms}.
  \end{align*}
  Hence $y^2 = g_r h_s$. In particular, $2 = r+s$.

\item[(3)]
  If $y \mid g_r$ and $y \mid h_s$, then
  \begin{align*}
    I(P, g \cap L) > m_P(g) m_P(L) = r \Longrightarrow& I(P, g \cap L) \geq r+1 \\
    I(P, h \cap L) > m_P(h) m_P(L) = s \Longrightarrow& I(P, g \cap L) \geq s+1.
  \end{align*}
  So,
  \begin{align*}
    3
    &= I(P, f \cap L) \\
    &= I(P, g \cap L) + I(P, h \cap L) \\
    &\geq (r+1) + (s+1) \\
    &= 4,
  \end{align*}
  which is absurd.
  So we might assume that $g_r = 1$ and $h_s = y^2$.
  $f = gh$ implies that $g = 1 + g_1 + \cdots$ is not passing through $P$.
  Hence the conclusion is established.

  Show that $P$ is an ordinary multiple point on $f$.

  $\overline{L_i} = \overline{g_i} \neq 0$,
  and $L_i$ is the tangent to $g_i$,

  Thus $f$ has $m$ tangents at $P$.)}

  \[
    \dim_k \mathscr{O}_P(f)/(g_i) > m.
  \]
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $\mathscr{B} = \{ x, y \}$ is a basis for $V$ as a $k$-vector space.

\item[(2)]
  $\mathscr{B}' = \{ \overline{x}, \overline{y} \}$ is a basis for $\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2$.
  as a $k$-vector space.

\item[(3)]
  By (1)(2), we can define a canonical isomorphism
  \[
    \alpha: V \to \mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2
  \]
  by sending $\mathscr{B}$ to $\mathscr{B}'$, that is,
  $\alpha(x) = \overline{x}$ and $\alpha(y) = \overline{y}$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \[
    f = \prod_{i=1}^{m} L_i + \text{higher terms}.
  \]
  Problem 3.19 says that $I(P, f \cap L_i) > m_P(f) = m$.

\item[(2)]
  Since $P$ is an ordinary multiple point on $f$,
  $L_i$ and $L_j$ are linearly independent in $V$ in the sense of (a).
  Hence, $\alpha(L_i) = \overline{L_i}$ and $\alpha(L_j) = \overline{L_j}$
  are linearly independent in $\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2$
  (since $\alpha$ is an isomorphism).
  The conclusion holds.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (c).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write $g_i = L_i + \text{higher terms} \in k[x,y]$.
  Here $g_i$ has no constant term since $P \in g_i$ by the defintion of intersection numbers.

\item[(2)]
  Pick $\lambda = 0 \in k$ and $j \neq i$.
  ($m > 1$ implies the existence of $j$.)
  So
  \[
    \alpha(L_i) = \overline{L_i} = \overline{g_i} \neq \lambda \overline{g_j} = 0
  \]
  or $L_i \neq 0$ (since $\alpha$ is an isomorphism).

\item[(3)]
  Hence, $L_i$ is the tangent to $g_i$.
  So Property (5) implies that
  \[
    I(P, f \cap g_i)
    \geq m_P(f) m_P(g_i)
    = m.
  \]
  Note that $L_i$ is the only tangent line of $g_i$.
  By Property (5),
  the assumption $I(P, f \cap g_i) > m$ implies that $L_i$ is tangent to $f$.

\item[(4)]
  Note that
  $\overline{g_i} \neq \lambda \overline{g_j}$ for all $i \neq j$, and all $\lambda \in k$.
  So $\overline{L_i} \neq \lambda \overline{L_j}$ for all $i \neq j$, and all $\lambda \in k$.
  Since $\alpha$ is an isomorphism, all $L_i$ are linearly independent
  and thus $f$ has $m$ tangents $L_1, \ldots, L_m$ at $P$.
  Therefore, $P$ is an ordinary multiple point.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (d).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Note that
  \[
    \dim_k \mathscr{O}_P(f)/(g_i)
    = \dim_k \mathscr{O}_P(\mathbf{A}^2)/(f, g_i)
    = I(P, f \cap g_i)
  \]
  (by Problem 2.44).

\item[(2)]
  ($\Longrightarrow$)
  Suppose that $P$ is an ordinary multiple point, with tangents $L_1, \ldots, L_m$.
  By (b),
  \[
    \dim_k \mathscr{O}_P(f)/(L_i) = I(P, f \cap L_i) > m
  \]
  and
  $\overline{L_i} \neq \lambda \overline{L_j}$ for all $i \neq j$, and all $\lambda \in k$.
  Take
  \[
    g_i = L_i + I(f) \in \Gamma(f) \subseteq \mathscr{O}_P(f).
  \]
  Since $g_i \in \mathfrak{m}$ (by $L_i(P) = 0$) and $\overline{g_i} = \overline{L_i}$,
  the conclusion is proved.

\item[(3)]
  ($\Longleftarrow$)
  Suppose that there are $g_1, \ldots, g_m \in \mathfrak{m}$ such that
  $\overline{g_i} \neq \lambda \overline{g_j}$,
  and $\dim_k \mathscr{O}_P(f)/(g_i) > m$.
  For each $i = 1, \ldots, m$,
  we take $g'_i + I(f) = g_i \in \mathfrak{m}$ for some $g'_i \in k[x,y]$.
  Although $g'_i$ is not uniquely determined by $g_i$,
  $\overline{g'_i} = \overline{g_i}$ and thus $\overline{g'_i} \neq \lambda \overline{g'_j}$.
  By (1),
  \[
    \dim_k \mathscr{O}_P(f)/(g_i)
    = \dim_k \mathscr{O}_P(f)/(g_i')
    = I(P, f \cap g_i') > m
  \]
  Hence, by (c) $f$ has $m$ tangents at $P$.

\emph{Proof.}

  ($\Longleftarrow$) Suppose that $f, g \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}]$ and $fg \in I$.

  Induction on the $\deg(fg) = r + s$.

\item[(3)]
  When $r + s = 0$, nothing to do.

\item[(4)]
  Assume that the result is true for smaller values of $r + s$.
  Then the highest homogeneous component $f_r g_s$ of $fg$ is also in $I$

  By assumption, $f_r \in I$ or $g_s \in I$, and might say that $f_r \in I$.

  The highest homogeneous component ${f_r}^m$ of $f^{m}$ is also in $I$

    =& \: \lambda \sum_{j} c_{ij}a_j + \mu \sum_{j} c_{ij}b_j \\
    =& \: \lambda t_i(P) + \mu t_i(Q),
  \end{align*}
  we have
  \begin{align*}
    t(L) = &\: \{ [ \lambda t_1(P) + \mu t_1(Q) : \cdots :
        \lambda t_{n+1}(P) + \mu t_{n+1}(Q) ] \\
      & \qquad : \lambda, \mu \in k, \lambda \neq 0 \text{ or } \mu \neq 0 \}.
  \end{align*}
  Moreover, $t(P) \in t(L)$ as $(\lambda,\mu) = (1,0)$,
  $t(Q) \in t(L)$ as $(\lambda,\mu) = (0,1)$,
  and $t(P) \neq t(Q)$ (since $P \neq Q$ and $t$ is a projective change of coordinates.)
  Therefore, $t(L)$ is the line through $t(P)$ and $t(Q)$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  First, write $L$ as the system of equations
  \[
    x_i = \lambda a_i + \mu b_i 
  \]
  ($i = 1, \ldots, n+1$)
  where $\lambda, \mu \in k, \lambda \neq 0 \text{ or } \mu \neq 0$.
  Since $P \neq Q \in \mathbf{P}^n$, there exist $1 \leq \alpha, \beta \leq n$
  such that
  \[
    \begin{vmatrix}
      a_\alpha & b_\alpha \\
      a_\beta & b_\beta
    \end{vmatrix}
    = a_\alpha b_\beta - b_\alpha a_\beta
    \neq 0.
  \]
  So we can solve $\lambda$ and $\mu$ in terms of $x_\alpha$ and $x_\beta$ by Cramer's rule,
  say
  \[
    \lambda = \frac{x_\alpha b_\beta - b_\alpha x_\beta}{a_\alpha b_\beta - b_\alpha a_\beta},
    \qquad
    \mu = \frac{a_\alpha x_\beta - x_\alpha a_\beta}{a_\alpha b_\beta - b_\alpha a_\beta}.
  \]

\item[(2)]
  Define
  \[
    V
    = V\left(
      x_i = \frac{x_\alpha b_\beta - b_\alpha x_\beta}{a_\alpha b_\beta - b_\alpha a_\beta} a_i
        + \frac{a_\alpha x_\beta - x_\alpha a_\beta}{a_\alpha b_\beta - b_\alpha a_\beta} b_i
      : 1 \leq i \leq n \right).
  \]
  By construction, $L = V$ is a linear subvariety in $\mathbf{P}^n$. (See Problem 4.11.)

\item[(TODO)]
  Note that
  \begin{align*}
    n - \dim(L)
    &= \text{the rank of the corresponding augmented matrix $(A'|b')$} \\
    &= \text{the maximal number of the linearly independent rows of $(A'|b')$} \\
    &= n - 1,
  \end{align*}
  which is uniquely determined.
  Therefore, $\dim(V) = 1$.

\item[(TODO)]
  Conversely, $\dim(V) = 1$ implies that $\mathrm{rank}(A'|b') = n - 1$.
  So all leading terms are all $x_i$ except only one $x_j$ for some $j$.
  Hence $V$ is of the form
  \[
    V
    = (x_i + a_{ij} x_j = b_i)
  \]
  for $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $i \neq j$.
  So
  \begin{align*}
    V
    &= \{ (b_1 - a_{1j}s, \ldots,
      \underbrace{s}_{\text{$j$th position}}, \ldots, b_n - a_{nj}s) : s \in k \} \\
    &= \{ (b_1 + s((b_1-a_{1j}) - b_1), \ldots,
      \underbrace{0 + s(1 - 0)}_{\text{$j$th position}}, \ldots, \\
      & \: \qquad (b_n + s((b_n-a_{nj}) - b_n) : s \in k \}
  \end{align*}
  is a line passing
  \begin{align*}
    P &= (b_1, \ldots, 0, \ldots, b_n) \\
    Q &= (b_1-a_{1j}, \ldots, 1, \ldots, b_n-a_{nj})
  \end{align*}
  with $P \neq Q$ (since they are different in the $j$th position).
  (Here we can change $P$ and $Q$ to any two different points on $V$.)
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (c).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(TODO)]
  A line $L \subseteq \mathbf{A}^{2}$ is $V(x+ay=b)$ or $V(x+ay=b)$ by (b).
  In any case, $L$ is a hyperplane in $\mathbf{A}^{2}$.

\item[(TODO)]
  Conversely, given any hyperplane $V = V(ax + by + c = 0) \subseteq \mathbf{A}^{2}$
  where $a$ and $b$ are not all zero.
  Might assume that $a \neq 0$. (The case $b \neq 0$ is similar.)
  So
  \[
    V = \left\{ \left(-\frac{c}{a}-\frac{b}{a}s, s\right) : s \in k \right\}
  \]
  is a line passing $\left(-\frac{c}{a}, 0\right)$ and $\left(-\frac{c+b}{a}, 1\right)$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (d).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(TODO)]
  It suffices to show that there is a bijective affine change of coordinates $t$ of $\mathbf{A}^{2}$
  such that $t(P) = (0,0)$, $t(L_1) = V(x = 0)$ and $t(L_2) = V(y = 0)$.
  Write $P = (p_1, p_2)$ and $L_i = a_i x + b_i y + c_i$ for $i = 1, 2$.

\item[(TODO)]
  Let $t'' = (t''_1, t''_2)$ be a translation defined by
  \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      t''_1 \\
      t''_2
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \begin{pmatrix}
        x - p_1 \\
        y - p_2
      \end{pmatrix}.
  \]
  So ${L_1}^{t''} = a_1 x + b_1 y$ and ${L_2}^{t''} = a_2 x + b_2 y$.
  Let
  \[
    A = \begin{pmatrix}
      a_1 & b_1 \\
      a_2 & b_2
    \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  and $t' = (t'_1, t'_2)$ be a linear map defined by
  \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      t'_1 \\
      t'_2
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \frac{1}{\det(A)}
      \begin{pmatrix}
        b_2 & -b_1 \\
        -a_2 & a_1
      \end{pmatrix}
      \begin{pmatrix}
        x \\
        y
      \end{pmatrix}.
  \]
  ($t'$ is well-defined since $L_1$ and $L_2$ are distinct lines and thus $\det(A) \neq 0$.)
  Write $t = (t_1, t_2) = t' \circ t''$.
  So
  \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      t_1 \\
      t_2
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \frac{1}{\det(A)}
      \begin{pmatrix}
        b_2 & -b_1 \\
        -a_2 & a_1
      \end{pmatrix}
      \begin{pmatrix}
        x - p_1 \\
        y - p_2
      \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  and
  \begin{align*}
    L_1^{t} = ({L_1}^{t''})^{t'} = x \\
    L_2^{t} = ({L_2}^{t''})^{t'} = y.
  \end{align*}

\item[(TODO)]
  Conversely, define an affine change of coordinates $s = (s_1, s_2)$ of $\mathbf{A}^{2}$
  by
  \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      s_1 \\
      s_2
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \begin{pmatrix}
      a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 \\
      a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2
    \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  so that $x^{s} = L_1$ and $y^{s} = L_2$.

\item[(4)]
  By (2)(3), the statement in (1) is established.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 4.14.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 4.14.*}
\emph{Let $P_1, P_2, P_3$ (resp. $Q_1, Q_2, Q_3$) be three points in $\mathbf{P}^2$
not lying on a line.
Show that there is a projective change of coordinates
$t: \mathbf{P}^2 \to \mathbf{P}^2$ such that $t(P_i) = Q_i$, $i = 1, 2, 3$.
Extend this to $n+1$ points in $\mathbf{P}^{n}$, not lying on a hyperplane.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    P_i &= [a_{i1} : a_{i2} : a_{i3}] \in \mathbf{P}^2(k) \\
    Q_i &= [b_{i1} : b_{i2} : b_{i3}] \in \mathbf{P}^2(k)
  \end{align*}
  for $i = 1, 2, 3$.

\item[(2)]
  Define
  \begin{align*}
    A
    &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      P_1 & P_2 & P_3
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      a_{11} & a_{21} & a_{31} \\
      a_{12} & a_{22} & a_{32} \\
      a_{13} & a_{23} & a_{33}
    \end{bmatrix} \\
    B
    &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      Q_1 & Q_2 & Q_3
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      b_{11} & b_{21} & b_{31} \\
      b_{12} & b_{22} & b_{32} \\
      b_{13} & b_{23} & b_{33}
    \end{bmatrix}.
  \end{align*}
  Note that
  $A$ (resp. $B$) is depending on the representations of $P_i$ (resp. $Q_i$)
  up to a nonzero constant in $k$.

\item[(3)]
  Here $A$ is invertible since $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are not lying on a line.
  Define $t: \mathbf{P}^2 \to \mathbf{P}^2$ by sending $P = [x:y:z] \in \mathbf{P}^2$
  to
  \[
    t(P)
    = BA^{-1}P
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      b_{11} & b_{21} & b_{31} \\
      b_{12} & b_{22} & b_{32} \\
      b_{13} & b_{23} & b_{33}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      a_{11} & a_{21} & a_{31} \\
      a_{12} & a_{22} & a_{32} \\
      a_{13} & a_{23} & a_{33}
    \end{bmatrix}^{-1}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      x \\
      y \\
      z
    \end{bmatrix}.
  \]
  Note that the matrix $BA^{-1} \in \mathrm{GL}_3(k)$
  depends on the representations of $P_i$ (resp. $Q_i$)
  up to a nonzero constant in $k$.
  Hence, $t$ is a well-defined map from $\mathbf{P}^2$ to $\mathbf{P}^2$.
  Besides, $t$ is a projective change of coordinates mapping $P_i$ to $Q_i$
  ($i = 1, 2, 3$).

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Generalization:
  Let $P_i$ (resp. $Q_i$) be $n+1$ points in $\mathbf{P}^n$ ($i = 1, \ldots, n+1$)
  not lying on a hyperplane.
  Then there is a projective change of coordinates
  $t: \mathbf{P}^n \to \mathbf{P}^n$ such that $t(P_i) = Q_i$ ($i = 1, \ldots, n+1$).}
  The proof is the same except replacing $2$ by $n$.

$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 4.15.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 4.15.*}
\emph{Show that any two distinct lines in $\mathbf{P}^2$ intersect in one point.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let
  \begin{align*}
    L_1 &: a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z = 0 \\
    L_2 &: a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z = 0
  \end{align*}
  be two distinct lines in $\mathbf{P}^2$.

\item[(2)]
  View (1) as the system of linear equations.
  Let the coefficient matrix $A$ be
  \[
    A
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      a_1 & b_1 & c_1 \\
      a_2 & b_2 & c_2
    \end{bmatrix}.
  \]
  Since $L_1$ and $L_2$ are distinct, $\rank(A) = 2$.
  The rank-nullity theorem shows that
  \[
    \dim_k \ker(A) = 3 - \rank(A) = 1.
  \]

\item[(3)]
  Might take a basis $\{ (x_0, y_0, z_0) \}$ for $\ker(A)$.
  Here $(x_0, y_0, z_0) \neq 0$ and
  any other nonzero solutions of $L_1 \cap L_2$ is of the form
  $(\lambda x_0, \lambda y_0, \lambda z_0)$ ($\lambda \neq 0$).
  Therefore,
  \[
    L_1 \cap L_2 = \{ [x_0:y_0:z_0] \} \in \mathbf{P}^2.
  \]
