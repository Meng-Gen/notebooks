\subsubsection*{Problem 1.1.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.1.*}
\emph{Let $R$ be a domain.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{If $f$, $g$ are forms of degree $r$, $s$ respectively in $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$,
  show that $fg$ is a form of degree $r+s$.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that any factor of a form in $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is also a form. } \\
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    f &= \sum_{(i)} a_{(i)} x^{(i)}, \\
    g &= \sum_{(j)} b_{(j)} x^{(j)},
  \end{align*}
  where $\sum_{(i)}$ is the summation over $(i) = (i_1,\ldots,i_n)$ with $i_1+\cdots+i_n = r$
  and $\sum_{(j)}$ is the summation over $(j) = (j_1,\ldots,j_n)$ with $j_1+\cdots+j_n = s$.

\item[(2)]
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    fg
    &= \sum_{(i)} \sum_{(j)} a_{(i)}b_{(j)} x^{(i)}x^{(j)} \\
    &= \sum_{(i),(j)} a_{(i)}b_{(j)} x^{(k)}
  \end{align*}
  where $(k) = (i_1+j_1,\ldots,i_n+j_n)$ with $(i_1+j_1)+\cdots+(i_n+j_n) = r+s$.
  Each $x^{(k)}$ is the form of degree $r+s$ and $a_{(i)}b_{(j)} \in R$.
  Hence $fg$ is a form of degree $r+s$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Given any form $f \in R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, and write $f = gh$.
  \emph{It suffices to show that $g$ is a form as well.}
  (So does $h$.)

\item[(2)]
  Write
  \[
    g = g_0+\cdots+g_r,
    \qquad
    h = h_0+\cdots+h_s
  \]
  where $g_r \neq 0$ and $h_s \neq 0$.
  So
  \[
    f = gh = g_0h_0 + \cdots + g_r h_s.
  \]
  Since $R$ is a domain, $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is a domain and thus $g_r h_s \neq 0$.
  The maximality of $r$ and $s$ implies that $\deg f = r+s$.
  Therefore, by the maximality of $r+s$,
  $f = g_r h_s$, or $g = g_r$, or $g$ is a form.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.2.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.2.*}
\emph{Let $R$ be a UFD,
$K$ the quotient field of $R$.
Show that every element $z$ of $K$ may be written $z = a/b$,
where $a, b \in R$ have no common factors;
this representative is unique up to units of $R$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that every element $z$ of $K$ may be written $z=a/b$,
  where $a$, $b\in R$ have no common factors.}
  Given any $z = a/b \in K$ where $a, b\in R$.
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    a &= p_1 \cdots p_n, \\
    b &= q_1 \cdots q_m
  \end{align*}
  where all $p_1, \ldots, p_n, q_1, \ldots, q_m$ are irreducible in $R$.
  (It is possible since $R$ is a UFD.)
  For each $i$, suppose $p_i \mid q_j$ for some $i, j$.
  Write $q_j = p_i u$ for some $u \in R$.
  By the irreducibility of $p_i$ and $q_j$, $u$ is a unit.
  So
  \[
    z
    = \frac{a}{b}
    = \frac{p_1 \cdots \widehat{p_i} \cdots p_n}{q_1 \cdots \widehat{q_j} \cdots q_m}
    = \frac{p_1 \cdots \widehat{p_i} \cdots p_n}{u q_1 \cdots \widehat{q_j} \cdots q_m}.
  \]
  Continue this method we can write $z = \frac{a'}{b'}$ where $a'$ and $b'$ have no common factors.

\item[(2)]
  Write $z = a/b = a'/b'$ where
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    $a, b, a', b' \in R$,

  \item[(b)]
    $a$ and $b$ have no common factors,

  \item[(c)]
    $a'$ and $b'$ have no common factors.
  \end{enumerate}
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    a &= p_1 \cdots p_n, \\
    b &= q_1 \cdots q_m, \\
    a' &= p'_1 \cdots p'_{n'}, \\
    b' &= q'_1 \cdots q'_{m'}
  \end{align*}
  where all $p_i, q_j, p'_{i'}, q'_{j'}$ are irreducible in $R$.
  As $z = a/b = a'/b'$, $ab' = a'b$ or
  \[
    p_1 \cdots p_n q'_1 \cdots q'_{m'}
    = p'_1 \cdots p'_{n'} q_1 \cdots q_m.
  \]

\item[(3)]
  For $i = 1$, $p_1 = u_1 p'_{i'}$ for some unit $u_1 \in R$
  since $a$ and $b$ have no common factors and all $p_1, q_j, p'_{i'}$ are irreducible.
  Hence
  \[
    u_1 \widehat{p_1} p_2 \cdots p_n q'_1 \cdots q'_{m'}
    = p'_1 \cdots \widehat{p'_{i'}} \cdots p'_{n'} q_1 \cdots q_m.
  \]
  Continue this method,
  we have $n \leq n'$ and all $p_1, \ldots, p_n$ are canceled.

\item[(4)]
  Conversely, we can apply the argument in (3) to $i' = 1, \ldots n'$ to conclude that $n' \leq n$.
  Therefore, $n = n'$ and
  \[
    \underbrace{u_1 \cdots u_n}_{\text{a unit in $R$}} q'_1 \cdots q'_{m'} = q_1 \cdots q_m.
  \]
  Hence, $b = ub'$ where $u = u_1 \cdots u_n$ is a unit in $R$.
  Similarly, $a = va'$ where $v$ is a unit in $R$.
  So the representative of $z \in K$ is unique up to units of $R$.

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.3.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.3.*}
\emph{Let $R$ be a PID. Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a nonzero, proper, prime ideal in $R$.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathfrak{p}$ is generated by an irreducible element.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathfrak{p}$ is maximal.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $\mathfrak{p} = (a)$ be a nonzero, proper, prime ideal in $R$.
  It suffices to show that $a$ is irreducible.

\item[(2)]
  Suppose $a = bc$.
  By the primality of $\mathfrak{p}$, $b \in \mathfrak{p}$ or $c \in \mathfrak{p}$.
  Suppose $b \in \mathfrak{p} = (a)$. (The case $c \in \mathfrak{p}$ is similar.)
  Then there is a $d \in R$ such that $b = ad$.
  Hence, $a = bc = adc$ or $(1-dc)a = 0$.

\item[(3)]
  Since $R$ is a domain, $1 = dc$ or $a = 0$.
  $a = 0$ implies that $\mathfrak{p} = (0)$ is a zero ideal, contrary to the assumption.
  Therefore, $1 = dc$, or $c$ is a unit, or $a$ is irreducible.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Given any ideal $I = (b)$ of $R$ containing $\mathfrak{p} = (a)$.
  As the generator $a$ of $\mathfrak{p}$ is in $\mathfrak{p} \subseteq I$,
  there is some $c \in R$ such that $a = bc$.
  By the irreducibility of $a$ (in (a)), $b$ is a unit or $c$ is a unit.

\item[(2)]
  $b$ is a unit implies that $I = R$.
  $c$ is a unit implies that $I = \mathfrak{p}$.
  In any case, we conclude that $\mathfrak{p}$ is maximal.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.4.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.4.*}
\emph{Let $k$ be an infinite field,
$f \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$.
Suppose $f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) = 0$ for all $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in k$.
Show that $f = 0$.
(Hint: Write
\[
  f = \sum f_i x_n^{i},
  \qquad
  f_i \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}].
\]
Use induction on $n$,
and the fact that $f(a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}, x_n)$
has only a finite number of roots if any $f_i(a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}) \neq 0$.)} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Induction on $n$.
  The case $n = 1$.
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  If there were a nonzero $f \in k[x_1]$ such that $f(a) = 0$ for all $a \in k$.
  Note that $f$ has at most $\deg f < \infty$ roots,
  contrary to the infinity of $k$.

\item[(2)]
  Assume that the conclusion holds for $n - 1$, then for any $f \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
  we can write
  \[
    f = \sum f_i x_n^{i},
    \qquad
    f_i \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}]
  \]
  as $f \in (k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}])[x_n]$.
  Suppose $f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) = 0$ for all $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in k$.
  For fixed $a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}$,
  the polynomial $f(a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}, x_n) \in k[x_n]$ has all distinct roots in
  an infinite field $k$.
  By (1), $f(a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}, x_n) = 0 \in k[x_n]$,
  or each $f_i(a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}) = 0$.
  As all $a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}$ run over $k$,
  we can apply the induction hypothesis
  each $f_i(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}) = 0 \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}]$.
  Hence, $f = 0 \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_{n}]$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Note.}
If $k$ is a finite field of order $q = p^k$,
then the polynomial $f(x) = x^q - x$ has $q$ distinct roots in $k$. \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.5.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.5.*}
\emph{Let $k$ be any field.
Show that there are an infinitely number of irreducible monic polynomials in $k[x]$.
(Hint: Suppose $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ were all of them, and factor $f_1\cdots f_n+1$ into irreducible factors.)} \\

\emph{Proof (Due to Euclid).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  If
  $f_1, \ldots, f_n$ were all irreducible monic polynomials, then
  we consider
  \[
    g = f_1 \cdots f_n + 1 \in k[x].
  \]
  So there is an irreducible monic polynomial $f = f_i$ dividing $g$ for some $i$
  since
  \[
    \deg g = \deg f_1 + \cdots + \deg f_n \geq 1
  \]
  and $k[x]$ is a UFD.

\item[(2)]
  However, $f$ would divide the difference
  \[
    g - f_1 \cdots f_{i-1} f_i f_{i+1} \cdots f_n = 1,
  \]
  contrary to $\deg f_i \geq 1$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.6.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.6.*}
\emph{Show that any algebraically closed field is infinite.
(Hint: The irreducible monic polynomials are $x - a$, $a \in k$.)} \\

\emph{Proof (Due to Euclid).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field.
  If $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ were all elements in $k$, then
  we consider a monic polynomials
  \[
    f(x) = (x - a_1) \cdots (x - a_n) + 1 \in k[x].
  \]

\item[(2)]
  Since $k$ is algebraically closed,
  there is an element $a \in k$ such that $f(a) = 0$.
  By assumption, $a = a_i$ for some $1 \leq i \leq n$,
  and thus $f(a) = f(a_i) = 1$, contrary to the fact that
  a field is a commutative ring where $0 \neq 1$ and all nonzero elements are invertible.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.7.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.7.*}
\emph{Let $k$ be a field, $f \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in k$.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that}
  \[
    f = \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n-a_n)^{i_n},
    \qquad
    \lambda_{(i)} \in k.
  \]

\item[(b)]
  \emph{If $f(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = 0$,
  show that $f = \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-a_i) g_i$ for some (not unique) $g_i$ in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Regard $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ as $(k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}])[x_n]$.
  Since $(k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}])[x_n]$ is a Euclidean domain with a function
  \[
    f \in (k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}])[x_n] \mapsto \deg_{x_n} f \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}
  \]
  satisfying the division-with-remainder property.

\item[(2)]
  Apply the division algorithm for $f$ and nonzero $x_n-a_n$
  to produce a quotient $q$ and remainder $r$ with
  $f = (x_n-a_n) q + r$ and either $r = 0$ or $\deg_{x_n}(r) < \deg_{x_n} (x_n-a_n) = 1$.
  That is, $r \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$ is a constant in $(k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}])[x_n]$.
  Continue this process to get that $f$ is of the form
  \[
    f = \sum_{i_n} f_{i_n} (x_n - a_n)^{i_n}
  \]
  where $f_{i_n} \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$.

\item[(3)]
  Use the same argument in (2) for each $f_{i_n} \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    f_{i_n}
    &= \sum_{i_{n-1}} \underbrace{f_{i_n,i_{n-1}}}_{\in k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-2}]}
      (x_{n-1} - a_{n-1})^{i_{n-1}} \\
    f_{i_n,i_{n-1}}
    &=
    \sum_{i_{n-2}} \underbrace{f_{i_n,i_{n-1},i_{n-2}}}_{\in k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-3}]}
      (x_{n-2} - a_{n-2})^{i_{n-2}}, \\
    & \cdots \\
    f_{i_n,\ldots,i_{2}}
    &= \sum_{i_1} \underbrace{f_{i_n,\ldots,i_1}}_{\in k} (x_1 - a_1)^{i_1}.
  \end{align*}
  Note that $f_{i_n,\ldots,i_1} \in k$, we can write
  \[
    f = \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n-a_n)^{i_n},
    \qquad
    \lambda_{(i)} \in k.
  \]
  by replacing all $f_{i_n,\ldots,i_k}$ by $f_{i_n,\ldots,i_{k-1}}$
  for $k = n, n-1, \ldots, 2$.

\item[(4)]
  Or use the induction on $n$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \[
    f = \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n-a_n)^{i_n},
    \qquad
    \lambda_{(i)} \in k
  \]
  by (a).

\item[(2)]
  As $f(a_1, \cdots, a_n) = 0$,
  $\lambda_{(i)} = 0$ if all $i_1, \ldots, i_n$ are zero, that it,
  there is no nonzero constant term in the representation of $f$.
  Hence, for each term
  \[
    f_{(i)} : = \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n-a_n)^{i_n}
  \]
  with $\lambda_{(i)} \neq 0$,
  there exists one $i_k > 0$ for some $1 \leq k \leq n$.
  So we can write
  \[
    f_{(i)}
    =
    (x_k-a_k)
      \underbrace{
        (\lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_k-a_k)^{i_k-1} \cdots (x_n-a_n)^{i_n})}_{
          := g_{(i)} \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]}.
  \]
  Note that the expression of $f_{(i)}$ is not unique since
  there may exist more than one $i_k > 0$ as $1 \leq k \leq n$.

\item[(3)]
  Now we iterate each nonzero term in $f$, apply the factorization in (2),
  and then group by each $x_k-a_k$.
  Therefore, we can write
  \[
    f = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-a_i)g_i
  \]
  for some $g_1 \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$.

\item[(4)]
  The expression of $f$ is not unique.
  For example, take $f(x,y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \in k[x,y]$.
  As $f(0,0) = 0$, we can write
  \begin{align*}
    f(x,y)
    &= x \cdot \underbrace{(x+2y)}_{g_1} + y \cdot \underbrace{y}_{g_2}, \text{ or } \\
    &= x \cdot \underbrace{(x+y)}_{g_1} + y \cdot \underbrace{(x+y)}_{g_2}, \text{ or } \\
    &= x \cdot \underbrace{x}_{g_1} + y \cdot \underbrace{(2x+y)}_{g_2}.
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.8.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.8.*}
\emph{Show that the algebraic subsets of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ are just the finite subsets, together
with $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ itself.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $k[x]$ is a PID if $k$ is a field.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    Let $I$ be an ideal of $k[x]$.

  \item[(b)]
    If $I = \{0\}$ then $I = (0)$ and $I$ is principal.

  \item[(c)]
    If $I \neq \{0\}$, then take $f$ to be a polynomial of minimal degree in $I$.
    It suffices to show that $I = (f)$.
    Clearly, $(f) \subseteq I$ since $I$ is an ideal.
    Conversely, for any $g \in I$,
    \[
      g(x) = f(x)h(x) + r(x)
    \]
    for some $h, r \in k[x]$ with $r = 0$ or $\deg r < \deg f$ (as $k[x]$ is a Euclidean domain).
    Now as
    \[
      r = g - fh \in I,
    \]
    $r = 0$ (otherwise contrary to the minimality of $f$),
    we have $g = fh \in (f)$ for all $g \in I$.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(2)]
  Let $Y$ be an algebraic subset of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$,
  say $Y = V(I)$ for some ideal $I$ of $k[x]$.
  Since $k[x]$ is a PID, $I = (f)$ for some $f \in k[x]$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    If $f = 0$, then $I = (0)$ and $Y = V(0) = \mathbf{A}^1(k)$.

  \item[(b)]
    If $f \neq 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ has finitely many roots in $k$,
    say $a_1, \ldots, a_m \in k$.
    Hence,
    \[
      Y = V(I) = V(f) = \{ f(a) = 0 : a \in k \}
      = \{ a_1, \ldots, a_m \}
    \]
    is a finite subsets of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  By (a)(b), the result is established.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Notes.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  By the Hilbert basis theorem, $k[x]$ is Noetherian as $k$ is Noetherian.
  Hence, for any algebraic subset $Y = V(I)$ of $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$,
  we can write $I = (f_1, \cdots, f_m)$.
  Note that
  \[
    Y = V(I) = V(f_1) \cap \cdots \cap V(f_m).
  \]
  Now apply the same argument to get the same conclusion.

\item[(2)]
  Suppose $k = \overline{k}$.
  $\mathbf{A}^1(k)$ is irreducible, because its only proper closed subsets are finite,
  yet it is infinite
  (because $k$ is algebraically closed, hence infinite). \\

\emph{If $k$ is a finite field, show that every subset of $\mathbf{A}^{n}(k)$ is algebraic.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Every subset of $\mathbf{A}^{n}(k)$ is finite since
  $|\mathbf{A}^{n}(k)| = |k|^n$ is finite.

\item[(2)]
  Note that $V(x_1-a_1,\ldots,x_n-a_n) = \{ (a_1,\ldots,a_n) \} \subseteq \mathbf{A}^{n}(k)$
  (property (5) in this section)
  and any finite union of algebraic sets is algebraic (property (4) in this section).
  Thus, every subset of $\mathbf{A}^{n}(k)$ is algebraic (by (1)).

\emph{Give an example of a countable collection of algebraic sets whose union is not
algebraic.} \\

\item[(1)]
  Let $k = \mathbb{Q}$ be an infinite field.
  $V(x-a) = \{ a \}$ is an algebraic sets for all $a \in \mathbb{Q}$.
  In particular, $V(x-a) = \{ a \}$ is algebraic for all $a \in \mathbb{Z}$.

\item[(2)]
  Note that
  \[
    Y := \bigcup_{a \in \mathbb{Z}} V(x-a) = \mathbb{Z}
  \]
  is a countable union of algebraic sets.
  Since $Y$ is a proper subset of $k = \mathbb{Q}$,

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.14.*}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.14.*}
\emph{Let $f$ be a nonconstant polynomial in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$,
$k$ algebraically closed.
Show that $\mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - V(f)$ is infinite if $n \geq 1$,
and $V(f)$ is infinite if $n \geq 2$.
Conclude that the complement of any proper algebraic set is infinite.
(Hint: See Problem 1.4.)} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - V(f)$ is infinite if $n \geq 1$.}
  Since $f$ is a nonconstant polynomial in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$,
  we may assume that $\deg_{x_n}(f) > 0$.
  Hence
  \[
    x_n \mapsto f(1,\ldots,1,x_n)
  \]
  is a nonconstant polynomial of degree $\deg_{x_n}(f) > 0$ in $k[x_n]$.
  So $f$ has finitely many roots in $k$, say $\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m$ ($m \geq 0$).
  Hence,
  \[
    (1,\ldots,1,x_n) \neq 0
  \]
  whenever $x_n \neq \xi_m$.
  Such subset in $\mathbf{A}^{1}(k)$ is infinite since $k = \overline{k}$ (Problem 1.6).
  Therefore,
  \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - V(f)
    &=
    \{ (a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) : f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \neq 0 \} \\
    &\supseteq
    \{ a_n  \in \mathbf{A}^{1}(k) : f(1,\ldots,1,x_n) \neq 0 \}
  \end{align*}
  is infinite.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $V(f)$ is infinite if $n \geq 2$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    Similar to (1).
    Since $f$ is a nonconstant polynomial in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$,
    we may assume that $m := \deg_{x_n}(f) > 0$.
    Write
    \[
      f = \sum_{i=0}^{m} f_i(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}) x_n^{i}.
    \]
    Note that each $f_i$ is well-defined since $n \geq 2$.

  \item[(b)]
    If $f_n$ is constant in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$,
    then $f_n$ is nonzero (since $m > 0$) or $V(f_n) = \varnothing$.
    If $f_n$ is nonconstant in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]$,
    then the set $\mathbf{A}^{n-1}(k) - V(f_n)$ is infinite by (1).
    In any case,
    \[
      \mathbf{A}^{n-1}(k) - V(f_n)
    \]
    is infinite.

  \item[(c)]
    For each $P = (a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1}) \in \mathbf{A}^{n-1}(k) - V(f_n)$,
    \[
      g_P: x_n \mapsto f(P,x_n) = f(a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1},x_n)
    \]
    defines a polynomial in $k[x_n]$ of degree $m > 0$.
    Since $k = \overline{k}$, $g_P$ has at least one root $Q \in k$.
    Hence
    \[
      V(f) \supseteq
      \{ (P,Q) \in \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) : P \in \mathbf{A}^{n-1}(k) - V(f_n), g_P(Q) = 0 \}
    \]
    is infinite since the set $\mathbf{A}^{n-1}(k) - V(f_n)$ is infinite.
  \end{enumerate}
  \emph{Note.}
  It is not true if $k \neq \overline{k}$.
  For example, $V(x^2+y^2+1) = \varnothing$ in $\mathbf{A}^{2}(\mathbb{R})$.

\item[(3)]
  Note that
  \[
    \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - V(S)
    = \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - \bigcap_{f \in S} V(f)
    = \bigcup_{f \in S}( \mathbf{A}^{n}(k) - V(f) ).
  \]
  Thus the complement of any proper algebraic set is infinite by (1).

It is called the \textbf{product} of $V$ and $W$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}

  Write

    V &= V(S_V) = \{ P \in \mathbf{A}^n(k) : f(P) = 0 \: \forall f \in S_V \} \\
    W &= V(S_W) = \{ Q \in \mathbf{A}^m(k) : g(Q) = 0 \: \forall g \in S_W \},
  \end{align*}
  where $S_V \subseteq k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ and $S_W \subseteq k[y_1,\ldots,y_m]$.
  It suffices to show that

    V \times W = V(S),
  \]
  where
  $S \subseteq k[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m]$ is the union of $S_V$ and $S_W$.

\item[(2)]
  Here we can identify $S_V$ with the subset of
  $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m]$
  by noting that
  \[
    k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]
    \hookrightarrow (k[y_1,\ldots,y_m])[x_1,\ldots,x_n]
    = k[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m].
  \]
  Here we regard $k$ as a subring of $k[y_1,\ldots,y_m]$.
  Similar treatment to $S_W$.

\item[(3)]
  By construction, $V \times W \subseteq V(S)$.
  Conversely, given any $(P,Q) \in V(S) \subseteq \mathbf{A}^{n+m}(k)$,
  we have $h(P,Q) = 0$ for all $h \in S = S_V \cup S_W$ (by (2)).
  By construction, $f(P) = 0$ for all $f \in S_V$ since $f$ only involve $x_1,\ldots,x_n$.
  Hence, $P \in V$. Similarly, $Q \in W$. Therefore, $(P,Q) \in V \times W$.

\item[(1)]
  (Proof of Equation (6) in this section.)
  \emph{Show that if $X \subseteq Y$, then $I(X) \supseteq I(Y)$.}
  If $f \in I(Y)$ then $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in Y$.

  $V(I(X)) \supseteq X$ for any set $X$ of points.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    If $f \in S$ then $f$ vanishes on $V(S)$,
    hence $f \in IV(S)$.

  \item[(b)]
    If $P \in X$ then every polynomial in $I(X)$ vanishes at $P$,
    so $P$ belongs to the zero set of $I(X)$.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(3)]
  (Proof of Equation (9) in this section.)
  \emph{$V(I(V(S))) = V(S)$ for any set $S$ of polynomials,
  and $I(V(I(X))) = I(X)$ for any set $X$ of points.
  So if $V$ is an algebraic set, $V = V(I(V))$,
  and if $I$ is the ideal of an algebraic set, $I = I(V(I))$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    In each case, it suffices to show that the left side is a subset of the right side.
    (by Equations (6)(8) in this section).

  \item[(b)]
    If $P \in V(S)$ then $f(P) = 0$ for all $f \in I(V(S))$, so $P \in V(I(V(S)))$.

  \item[(c)]
    If $f \in I(X)$ then $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in V(I(X))$.
    Thus $f$ vanishes on $V(I(X))$, so $f \in I(V(I(X)))$.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $V = W$ if and only if $I(V) = I(W)$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    By Equation (6) in this section, $I(V) \supseteq I(W)$ if $V \subseteq W$
    and $I(V) \subseteq I(W)$ if $V \supseteq W$.
    Thus, $I(V) = I(W)$ if $V = W$.

  \item[(b)]
    Conversely,
    $I(V) = I(W)$ implies that $V(I(V)) = V(I(W))$
    by Equation (3) in the previous section and similar argument in (a).
    By Equation (9) in this section, $V(I(V)) = V$ and $V(I(W)) = W$.

\begin{enumerate}

  By the binomial theorem,

  By definition $a^n \in \mathrm{rad}(I)$ for some positive integer $n$.

\emph{Show that $I = (x^2+1) \subseteq \mathbb{R}[x]$ is a radical (even a prime) ideal,
but $I$ is not the ideal of any set in $\mathbf{A}^1(\mathbb{R})$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $I = (x^2+1)$ is a prime ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x]$.}
  Given any $fg \in I$.
  It suffices to show that $f \in I$ or $g \in I$.
  By definition of $I$,
  there is a polynomial $h \in \mathbb{R}[x]$ such that $fg = (x^2+1)h$.
  So $(x^2+1) \mid f$ or $(x^2+1) \mid g$
  since $x^2+1$ is irreducible in a unique factorization domain $\mathbb{R}[x]$.
  Therefore, $f \in I$ or $g \in I$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $I$ is not the ideal of any set in $\mathbf{A}^1(\mathbb{R})$.}
  Since $x^2+1$ has no roots in $\mathbb{R}$,
  $I$ cannot be the ideal of any nonempty set in $\mathbf{A}^1(\mathbb{R})$.

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $V(I) = V(\mathrm{rad}(I))$.}
  Since $I \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(I)$,
  it suffices to show that $V(I) \subseteq V(\mathrm{rad}(I))$.
  Given any $P \in V(I)$.
  For any $f \in \mathrm{rad}(I)$, $f^n \in I$ for some positive integer $n > 0$.
  Note that
  \[
    0 = (f^n)(P) = f(P)^n
  \]
  since $f^n \in I$ and $P \in V(I)$.
  As $k$ is a domain, $f(P)^n = 0$ implies $f(P) = 0$. So $P \in V(\mathrm{rad}(I))$.

and that the natural homomorphism from $k$ to $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$ is an isomorphism.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $I$ is a maximal ideal.}
  Suppose that $J$ is an ideal such that $J \supsetneq I$.
  Take any $f \in J - I$.
  By Problem 1.7(a),
  \[
    f = \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n - a_n)^{i_n}.
  \]
  As $f \not\in I$, there is a nonzero constant term in $f$, say $\lambda \in k - \{0\}$.
  Note that $f - \lambda \in I \subsetneq J$.
  Hence,
  \[
    \lambda = f - (f - \lambda) \in J
  \]
  since $J$ is an ideal.
  As $\lambda \neq 0$, $J = k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is not a proper ideal containing $I$.

\item[(2)]
  Let $\varphi: k \to k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$ be the natural homomorphism.
  (That is, $\varphi: \lambda \to \lambda + I \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$.)

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $\varphi$ is surjective.}
  Given any $f + I \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$.
  By Problem 1.7(a),
  \[
    f = \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n - a_n)^{i_n}.
  \]
  So
  \begin{align*}
    f + I
    &= \sum \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n - a_n)^{i_n} + I \\
    &= \left(f(a_1,\ldots,a_n)
      + \sum_{\text{nonconstant}} \lambda_{(i)} (x_1-a_1)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n - a_n)^{i_n} \right) + I \\
    &= f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) + I.
  \end{align*}
  (Here the summation over all nonconstant terms is in $I$.)
  Hence
  \[
    \varphi: f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in k \mapsto f + I.
  \]

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $\varphi$ is injective.}
  $\ker(\varphi) = \{ \lambda \in k : \lambda \in I \} = k \cap I = \{0\}$
  since $I$ is a proper ideal.

\item[(5)]
  By (2)(3)(4), $\varphi: k \to k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(x_1-a_1,\ldots,x_n-a_n)$
  is an isomorphism.

\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that for every ideal $J'$ of $R/I$,
  $\pi^{-1}(J') = J$ is an ideal of $R$ containing $I$,
  and for every ideal $J$ of $R$ containing $I$,
  $\pi(J) = J'$ is an ideal of $R/I$.
  This sets up a natural one-to-one correspondence between

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that for every ideal $J'$ of $R/I$,
  $\pi^{-1}(J') = J$ is an ideal of $R$ containing $I$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    \emph{Show that $J$ contains $I$.}
    Note that $\pi^{-1}(0) = I \subseteq \pi^{-1}(J') = J$.
    So $J$ contains $I$. In particular, $J \neq \varnothing$ since $I \neq \varnothing$.

  \item[(b)]
    \emph{Show that $J$ is a additive subgroup of $R$.}
    It suffices to show that
    $a - b \in J$

    Actually,
    \[
      \pi(a - b) = \pi(a) - \pi(b) \in J'

    implies $a - b \in \pi^{-1}(J') = J$.

  \item[(c)]
    \emph{Show that for every $r \in R$ and every $a \in J$,
    the product $ra \in J$.}
    In fact,
    \[
      \pi(ra) = \pi(r) \pi(a) \in J'

    implies $ra \in \pi^{-1}(J') = J$.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that for every ideal $J$ of $R$ containing $I$,
  $\pi(J) = J'$ is an ideal of $R/I$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    \emph{Show that $J'$ is nonempty.}
    Note that $\pi(a) = 0 \in \pi(I) \subseteq \pi(J) = J'$ for any $a \in I$.
    So $J'$ is nonempty since $J$ is nonempty.

  \item[(b)]
    \emph{Show that $J'$ is a additive subgroup of $R/I$.}
    It suffices to show that
    $\pi(a) - \pi(b) \in J'$ for any $\pi(a) \in J'$, $\pi(b) \in J'$, $a \in J$ and $b \in J$.
    It is trivial since
    \[
      \pi(a) - \pi(b) = \pi(a - b) \in \pi(J) = J',
    \]
    $\pi$ is a ring homomorphism and $J$ is an ideal.

  \item[(c)]
    \emph{Show that for every $\pi(r) \in R/I$ ($r \in R$) and every $\pi(a) \in J'$ ($a \in J$),
    the product $\pi(r)\pi(a) \in J'$.}
    It is trivial since
    \[
      \pi(r)\pi(a) = \pi(ra) \in \pi(J) = J',
    \]
    $\pi$ is a ring homomorphism and $J$ is an ideal.

\item[(3)]
  By (1)(2), we setup the correspondence between
  \[
    \{ \text{ideals of $R/I$} \}
    \longleftrightarrow
    \{ \text{ideals of $R$ that contain $I$} \}.
  \]
  Note that this correspondence preserves the subset relation,
  and thus this correspondence is one-to-one.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $J'$ is radical if $J$ is radical.}
  It suffices to show that $(a + I)^n = a^n + I \in J'$ implies that $a + I \in J'$.
  Note that
  \[
    (a + I)^n = a^n + I \in J'
  \]
  implies that $a^n \in J$ or $a \in J$ since $J$ is radical.
  Hence $a + I \in J/I = J'$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $J$ is radical if $J'$ is radical.}
  It suffices to show that $a^n \in J$ implies that $a \in J$.
  Note that
  \[
    \pi(a^n) = \pi(a)^n \in J'
  \]
  implies that $\pi(a) \in J'$ since $J'$ is radical.
  $a \in \pi^{-1}(J') = J$.

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $J'$ is prime if $J$ is prime.}
  It suffices to show that
  $(a + I)(b + I) = ab + I \in J'$ implies that $a + I \in J'$ or $b + I \in J'$.
  Note that
  \[
    (a + I)(b + I) = ab + I \in J'
  \]
  implies that $ab \in J$. So $a \in J$ or $b \in J$ by the primality of $J$.
  Hence $a + I \in J'$ or $b + I \in J'$.

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $J$ is prime if $J'$ is prime.}
  It suffices to show that $ab \in J$ implies that $a \in J$ or $b \in J$.
  Note that
  \[
    \pi(ab) = \pi(a)\pi(b) \in J'
  \]
  implies that $\pi(a) \in J'$ or $\pi(b) \in J'$ by the primality of $J'$.
  So $a \in \pi^{-1}(J') = J$ or $b \in \pi^{-1}(J') = J$.

\item[(5)]
  \emph{Show that $J'$ is maximal if $J$ is maximal.}
  Suppose $\mathfrak{m}$ is an ideal containing $J'$.
  By (a), $\pi^{-1}(\mathfrak{m})$ is an ideal containing $J$.
  So $\pi^{-1}(\mathfrak{m}) = J$ or $\pi^{-1}(\mathfrak{m}) = R$ by the maximality of $J$.
  Hence, $\mathfrak{m} = \pi(J) = J'$ or $\mathfrak{m} = \pi(R) = R/I$.

\item[(6)]
  \emph{Show that $J$ is maximal if $J'$ is maximal.}
  Suppose $\mathfrak{m}$ is an ideal containing $J$.
  By (a), $\pi(\mathfrak{m})$ is an ideal containing $J'$.
  So $\pi(\mathfrak{m}) = J'$ or $\pi(\mathfrak{m}) = R/I$ by the maximality of $J'$.
  Hence, $\mathfrak{m} = \pi^{-1}(J') = J$ or $\mathfrak{m} = \pi^{-1}(R/I) = R$.

\emph{Note.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Note that
  \[
    R/J \cong (R/I)/(J/I)

  if $J$ is an ideal of $R$ such that $I \subseteq J$.

\item[(2)]
  Hence, $J$ is prime iff $R/J \cong (R/I)/(J/I)$ is a domain iff $J/I$ is prime.

\item[(3)]
  Also, $J$ is maximal iff $R/J \cong (R/I)/(J/I)$ is a field iff $J/I$ is maximal. \\

\emph{Proof of (c).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $J'$ is finitely generated if $J$ is.}
  Suppose $J$ is generated by $a_1, \ldots, a_m$.
  It suffices to show that $J'$ is generated by
  \[
    a_1 + I, \ldots, a_m + I \in J/I.
  \]
  Given any $a + I \in J'$ where $a \in J$.
  Write $a = \sum_{1 \leq i \leq m} r_i a_i$ for some $r_i \in R$.
  Then
  \[
    a + I = \sum r_i a_i + I = \sum (r_i + I)(a_i + I)

  is generated by $a_1 + I, \ldots, a_m + I$.

  By the corollary to the Hilbert basis theorem,
  $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is Noetherian.
  By (2), the ring $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$ is Noetherian.

  \emph{Show that $f$ is an irreducible polynomial.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    Suppose

    V_i \cap W = (V_i \cap W_1) \cup \cdots \cup (V_i \cap W_s).
  \]
  By the irreducibility of $V_i$,
  there is only one $j$ such that $V_i \cap W_j = V_i$
  and other intersections are empty.
  Therefore, each irreducible component $V_i$ is contained in

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  If $\mathbf{A}^n(k)$ were reducible,
  then $\mathbf{A}^n(k) = V_1 \cup V_2$ where $V_1, V_2$ are algebraic sets in $\mathbf{A}^n(k)$,
  $V_1$ and $V_2$ are nonempty and proper in $\mathbf{A}^n(k)$.

\item[(2)]
  Take $P_i \in V_i$ for $i = 1, 2$.
  By Problem 1.17,
  there are two polynomials $f_1, f_2 \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
  such that $f_i(Q) = 0$ for all $Q \in V_i$ and $f_1(P_2) = f_2(P_1) = 1$.

\item[(3)]
  By construction,
  $(f_1 f_2)(a_1,\ldots,a_n) = 0$ for any $a_1,\ldots,a_n \in k$.
  As $k$ is infinite, $f_1 f_2 = 0$ by Problem 1.4.
  Since $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ is a domain, $f_1 = 0$ or $f_2 = 0$,
  contrary to $f_1(P_2) = f_2(P_1) \neq 0$.

  $\mathbf{A}^n(k)$ is reducible if $k$ is finite. \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.30.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.30.}
\emph{Let $k = \mathbb{R}$.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that $I(V(x^2+y^2+1))=(1)$.}

\item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that every algebraic subset of $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$ is equal to $V(f)$
  for some $f \in \mathbb{R}[x,y]$.}
\end{enumerate}
\emph{This indicates why we usually require that $k$ be algebraically closed.} \\



\emph{Proof of (a).}
$I(V(x^2+y^2+1)) = I(\varnothing) = (1)$
since $x^2+y^2+1 \geq 1$ is never zero for any $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$.
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Given any algebraic subset $V$ of $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.
  $V = V(1)$ if $V = \varnothing$.
  $V = V(0)$ if $V = \mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.
  Now suppose $V$ is a nonempty proper algebraic subset $V$ of $\mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$.
  Write $V = V_1 \cup \cdots \cup V_m$,
  where each $V_i$ is irreducible.
  Here $V_i \neq \varnothing$ and $V_i \neq \mathbf{A}^2(\mathbb{R})$ for all $i$.

\item[(2)]
  As $k = \mathbb{R}$ is infinite,
  Corollary 2 to Proposition 2 implies that each $V_i$ is either a point
  or an irreducible plane curves $V(f_i)$,
  where $f_i$ is an irreducible polynomial and $V(f_i)$ is infinite.

\item[(3)]
  If $V_i = \{ (a_i,b_i) \}$ is a point, then define
  \[
    f_i(x,y) = (x-a_i)^2 + (x-b_i)^2.
  \]
  By the property of $\mathbb{R}$, $V_i = V(f_i)$.

\item[(4)]
  Define $f = f_1 \cdots f_m \in \mathbb{R}[x,y]$.
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    V
    &= V_1 \cup \cdots \cup V_m \\
    &= V(f_1) \cup \cdots \cup V(f_m) \\
    &= V(f_1 \cdots f_m) \\
    &= V(f).

\emph{Show that the map which associates to each
$f \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ a polynomial function in $\mathscr{F}(V,k)$
is a ring homomorphism whose kernel is $I(V)$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Define a map $\alpha: k[x_1,\ldots,x_n] \to \mathscr{F}(V,k)$.
  Every polynomial $f \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ defines a function
  from $V$ to $k$ by
  \[
    \alpha(f)(a_1,\ldots,a_n) = f(a_1,\ldots,a_n)
  \]
  for all $(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in V$.

\item[(2)]
  $\alpha$ is a ring homomorphism by construction in (1).

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathrm{ker}(\alpha) = I(V)$.}
  In fact,
  given any $f \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, we have
  $\alpha(f) = 0$ (sending all $a \in V$ to $0 \in k$)
  if and only if $f(a) = 0$ for all $a \in V$
  if and only if $f \in I(V)$.

\item[(4)]
  Hence $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I(V) = \Gamma(V) \hookrightarrow \mathscr{F}(V,k)$
  is an injective homomorphism.

    Let $N = n_1 + \cdots + n_m$.
    Given any $x = \sum_{i=1}^{m} r_i x_i \in \mathrm{rad}(I)$,
    so
    \begin{align*}
      x^N
      &= \left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} r_i x_i \right)^{N} \\
      &= \sum_{k_1 + \cdots + k_m = N} {N \choose k_1,\ldots,k_m}
        r_1^{k_1} x_1^{k_1} \cdots r_m^{k_m} x_m^{k_m}.
    \end{align*}
    \item[(c)]
    Note that for each term there is some $j$ such that $k_j \geq n_j$.
    Hence,
    \begin{align*}
      & \: x_j^{k_j} = x_j^{k_j-n_j} x_j^{n_j} \in I
        &\text{($I$ is an ideal)} \\
      \Longrightarrow& \:

        &\text{($I$ is an ideal)} \\
      \Longrightarrow& \:
      x^N \in I.
        &\text{($I$ is an ideal)} \\

  \emph{Show that in a Noetherian ring the ideals $I$ and $J$ have the same radical
  iff there is some integer $N$ such that $I^N \subseteq J$ and $J^N \subseteq I$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)]
    $(\Longrightarrow)$
    Since in a Noetherian ring every ideal is finitely generated,
    $\mathrm{rad}(I)$ and $\mathrm{rad}(J)$ are finitely generated.
    By (1), there is a common integer $N$ such that
    \[
      (\mathrm{rad}(I))^N \subseteq I \:\: \text{ and } \:\:
      (\mathrm{rad}(J))^N \subseteq J.
    \]
    Note that $I^N \subseteq (\mathrm{rad}(I))^N$ and $J^N \subseteq (\mathrm{rad}(J))^N$.
    Since $\mathrm{rad}(I)$ = $\mathrm{rad}(J)$ by assumption,
    \begin{align*}
      I^N &\subseteq (\mathrm{rad}(I))^N = (\mathrm{rad}(J))^N \subseteq J, \\
      J^N &\subseteq (\mathrm{rad}(J))^N = (\mathrm{rad}(I))^N \subseteq I.
    \end{align*}
    \item[(b)]
    $(\Longleftarrow)$
    It suffices to show that $\mathrm{rad}(I) \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(J)$.
    $\mathrm{rad}(J) \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(I)$ is similar.
    Given any $x \in \mathrm{rad}(I)$, there is an integer $M > 0$ such that
    $x^M \in I$.
    Hence $x^{MN} \in I^N \subseteq J$, or $x \in \mathrm{rad}(J)$.

  \emph{Show that if $I, J \subseteq S = k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$

  then $Z(I) = Z(J)$ iff $I^N \subseteq J$ and $J^N \subseteq I$ for some $N$.}
  Note that $S$ is Noetherian and we can apply part (2).
  By the Nullstellensatz, $Z(I) = Z(J)$ iff $\mathrm{rad}(I) = \mathrm{rad}(J)$
  iff $I^N \subseteq J$ and $J^N \subseteq I$ for some $N$.

\subsubsection*{Problem 2.51.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 2.51.}
\emph{Let
\[
  0 \longrightarrow V_1 \longrightarrow \cdots \longrightarrow V_n \longrightarrow 0
\]
be an exact sequence of finite-dimensional vector spaces.
Show that $\sum (-1)^i \dim(V_i) = 0$.} \\

\emph{Proof (Proposition 7 in this section).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  For $i = 0,\ldots,n$,
  by the rank-nullity theorem for a linear transformation
  $\varphi_{i}: V_{i} \to V_{i+1}$, we have
  \[
    \dim V_{i} = \dim \mathrm{im}(\varphi_{i}) + \dim \mathrm{ker}(\varphi_{i}).
  \]
  (Here $V_0 = V_{n+1} := 0$ by convention.)

\item[(2)]
  By the exactness of the sequence, we have
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    $\mathrm{im}(\varphi_{i}) = \mathrm{ker}(\varphi_{i+1})$ for $i = 0,\ldots, n-1$.
    In particular, $\mathrm{ker}(\varphi_{1}) = \mathrm{im}(\varphi_{0}) = 0$.

  \item[(b)]
    $\mathrm{ker}(\varphi_{n}) = V_n$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (-1)^i \dim(V_i)
    &= \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (-1)^i \dim \mathrm{im}(\varphi_{i})
      + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (-1)^i \dim \mathrm{ker}(\varphi_{i}) \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (-1)^i \dim \mathrm{ker}(\varphi_{i+1})
      + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (-1)^i \dim \mathrm{ker}(\varphi_{i}) \\
    &= (-1)^{n-1} \dim \underbrace{\mathrm{ker}(\varphi_{n})}_{=V_n}
      + (-1)^1 \dim \underbrace{\mathrm{ker}(\varphi_{1})}_{= 0} \\
    &= -(-1)^n \dim V_n,
  \end{align*}
  or $\sum (-1)^i \dim(V_i) = 0$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\
