\textbf{Problem 1.1*.}
\emph{Let $R$ be a domain.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
\emph{If $F$, $G$ are forms of degree $r$, $s$ respectively in $R[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$,
show that $FG$ is a form of degree $r+s$.}
\item[(b)]
\emph{Show that any factor of a form in $R[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ is also a form. } \\
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    F &= \sum_{(i)} a_{(i)} X^{(i)}, \\
    G &= \sum_{(j)} b_{(j)} X^{(j)},
  \end{align*}
  where $\sum_{(i)}$ is the summation over $(i) = (i_1,\ldots,i_n)$ with $i_1+\cdots+i_n = r$
  and $\sum_{(j)}$ is the summation over $(j) = (j_1,\ldots,j_n)$ with $j_1+\cdots+j_n = s$.

\item[(2)]
  Hence,
  \begin{align*}
    FG
    &= \sum_{(i)} \sum_{(j)} a_{(i)}b_{(j)} X^{(i)}X^{(j)} \\
    &= \sum_{(i),(j)} a_{(i)}b_{(j)} X^{(k)}
  \end{align*}
  where $(k) = (i_1+j_1,\ldots,i_n+j_n)$ with $(i_1+j_1)+\cdots+(i_n+j_n) = r+s$.
  Each $X^{(k)}$ is the form of degree $r+s$ and $a_{(i)}b_{(j)} \in R$.
  Hence $FG$ is a form of degree $r+s$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Given any form $F \in R[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$, and write $F = GH$.
  \emph{It suffices to show that $G$ (or $H$) is a form as well.}

\item[(2)]
  Write
  \begin{align*}
    G &= G_0+\cdots+G_r, \\
    H &= H_0+\cdots+H_s
  \end{align*}
  where $G_r \neq 0$ and $H_s \neq 0$.
  So
  \[
    F = GH = G_0H_0 + \cdots + G_r H_s.
  \]
  Since $R$ is a domain, $R[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ is a domain and thus $G_r H_s \neq 0$.
  The maximality of $r$ and $s$ implies that $\deg(F) = r+s$.
  Therefore, by the maximality of $r+s$,
  $F = G_r H_s$, or $G = G_r$, or $G$ is a form.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$\\\\
