\textbf{Problem 3.6.}
\emph{Prove that $\hat{A} + \hat{B} = \hat{B} + \hat{A}$. } \\

Two operators $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ are said to be equal if
$\hat{A}f = \hat{B}f$ for all functions $f$. \\

\emph{Proof.}
$$(\hat{A} + \hat{B})f = \hat{A}f + \hat{B}f
= \hat{B}f + \hat{A}f = (\hat{B} + \hat{A})f$$
holds for any function $f$.
By definition,
$\hat{A} + \hat{B} = \hat{B} + \hat{A}$.
