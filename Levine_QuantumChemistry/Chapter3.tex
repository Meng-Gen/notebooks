\textbf{Problem 3.6.}
\emph{Prove that $\hat{A} + \hat{B} = \hat{B} + \hat{A}$. } \\

Two operators $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ are said to be equal if
$\hat{A}f = \hat{B}f$ for all functions $f$. \\

\emph{Proof.}
$$(\hat{A} + \hat{B})f = \hat{A}f + \hat{B}f
= \hat{B}f + \hat{A}f = (\hat{B} + \hat{A})f$$
holds for any function $f$.
By definition,
$\hat{A} + \hat{B} = \hat{B} + \hat{A}$.
$\Box$ \\\\

\textbf{Problem 3.7.}
\emph{Let $\hat{D} = d/dx$.
Verify that $(\hat{D}+x)(\hat{D}-x) = \hat{D}^2-x^2-1$. } \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{align*}
((\hat{D}+x)(\hat{D}-x))f
&= (\hat{D}+x)((\hat{D}-x)f) \\
&= (\hat{D}+x)(f'-xf) \\
&= (f'-xf)' + x(f'-xf) \\
&= (f''-f-xf') + (xf'-x^2f) \\
&= f''-f-x^2f \\
&= (\hat{D}^2-x^2-1)f
\end{align*}
holds for any function $f$.
By definition,
$(\hat{D}+x)(\hat{D}-x) = \hat{D}^2-x^2-1$.
$\Box$ \\\\
