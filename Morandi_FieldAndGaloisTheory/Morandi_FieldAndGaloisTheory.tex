\subsubsection*{Problem 1.1.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.1.}
\emph{Let $K$ be a field extension of $F$.
By defining scalar multiplication for $\alpha \in F$ and $a \in K$
by $\alpha \cdot a = \alpha a$, the multiplication in $K$,
show that $K$ is an $F$-vector space.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
$K$ is an additive group.
\item[(2)]
\emph{Show that $(\alpha \beta) \cdot a = \alpha \cdot (\beta \cdot a)$
for $\alpha, \beta \in F$ and $a \in K$.}
In fact,
\begin{align*}
(\alpha \beta) \cdot a
&= \alpha \beta a \in K, \\
\alpha \cdot (\beta \cdot a)
&= \alpha \beta a \in K.
\end{align*}
\item[(3)]
\emph{Show that $(\alpha + \beta) \cdot a = \alpha \cdot a + \beta \cdot a$
for $\alpha, \beta \in F$ and $a \in K$.}
\begin{align*}
(\alpha + \beta) \cdot a
&= (\alpha + \beta) a \\
&= \alpha a + \beta a \in K, \\
\alpha \cdot a + \beta \cdot a
&= \alpha a + \beta a \in K.
\end{align*}
\item[(4)]
\emph{Show that $\alpha \cdot (a + b) = \alpha \cdot a + \alpha \cdot b$
for $\alpha \in F$ and $a, b \in K$.}
\begin{align*}
\alpha \cdot (a + b)
&= \alpha (a + b) \\
&= \alpha a + \alpha b \in K, \\
\alpha \cdot a + \alpha \cdot b
&= \alpha a + \alpha b \in K.
\end{align*}
\item[(5)]
\emph{Show that $1 \cdot a = a$
for $a \in K$.}
$1 \cdot a = 1 a = a \in K$.
\end{enumerate}
By (1) to (5), $K$ is an $F$-vector space.
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.2.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.2.}
\emph{If $K$ is a field extension of $F$, prove that $[K:F] = 1$
if and only if $K = F$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
\emph{$[K:F] = 1 \Longleftarrow K = F$.}
Take a basis $\{1\}$ for $K$ as an $F$-vector space.
\item[(2)]
\emph{$[K:F] = 1 \Longrightarrow K = F$.}
Take a basis $\{a\}$ for $K$ as an $F$-vector space where $a \in K$.
Since $1 \in K$ as an $F$-vector space,
there exists $\alpha \in F$ such that $1 = \alpha a$.
$a = \alpha^{-1} \in F$, or $K \subseteq F$, or $K = F$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.3.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.3.}
\emph{Let $K$ be a field extension of $F$, and let $a \in K$.
Show that the evaluation map $\text{ev}_a: F[x] \to K$ given by
$\text{ev}_a(f(x)) = f(a)$ is a ring and and $F$-vector space homomorphism.
(Such a map is called an $F$-algebra homomorphism.) } \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
\emph{$\text{ev}_a$ is a ring homomorphism.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  $\text{ev}_a(f(x)+g(x)) = f(a) + g(a) = \text{ev}_a(f(x)) + \text{ev}_a(g(x))$.
  \item[(b)]
  $\text{ev}_a(f(x)g(x)) = g(a)g(b) = \text{ev}_a(f(x)) \text{ev}_a(g(x))$.
  \item[(c)]
  $\text{ev}_a(1) = 1$.
  \end{enumerate}
\item[(2)]
\emph{$\text{ev}_a$ is an $F$-vector space homomorphism.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  $\text{ev}_a(f(x)+g(x)) = f(a) + g(a) = \text{ev}_a(f(x)) + \text{ev}_a(g(x))$.
  \item[(b)]
  Given $c \in F$, $\text{ev}_a(cf(x)) = cf(a) = c\text{ev}_a(f(x))$.

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.4.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.4.}
\emph{Prove Proposition 1.9:
Let $K$ be a field extension of $F$ and let $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in K$.
Then
$$F[a_1, \ldots, a_n] = \{ f(a_1, \ldots, a_n) : f \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \}$$
and
$$F(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \left\{
\frac{f(a_1, \ldots, a_n)}{g(a_1, \ldots, a_n)} : f, g \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n],
g(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \neq 0
\right\},$$
so $F(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ is the quotient field of $F[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$.
} \\

\emph{Proof (Proposition 1.8).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
The evaluation map
$\text{ev}_{(a_1, \ldots, a_n)}: F[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \to K$ has image
$$\{ f(a_1, \ldots, a_n) : f \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \},$$
so this set is a subring of $K$.
\item[(2)]
If $R$ is a subring of $K$ that contains $F$ and $a_1, \ldots, a_n$,
then $$f(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \in R$$ for any $f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$
by closure of addition and multiplication.
\item[(3)]
So
$\{ f(a_1, \ldots, a_n) : f \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \}$ is contained in all subrings
of $K$ that contains $F$ and $a_1, \ldots, a_n$.
Hence
$$F[a_1, \ldots, a_n] = \{ f(a_1, \ldots, a_n) : f \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \}.$$
\item[(4)]
The quotient field of $F[a_1, \ldots, a_n]$ is then the set
$$\left\{
\frac{f(a_1, \ldots, a_n)}{g(a_1, \ldots, a_n)} : f, g \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n],
g(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \neq 0
\right\}.$$
It is clearly is contained in any subfield of $K$ that contains $F[a_1, \ldots, a_n]$;
hence, it is equal to $F(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.5.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.5.}
\emph{Show that 
$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5}, \sqrt{7}) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{7})$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5}, \sqrt{7}) \supseteq \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{7})$
since $\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{7} \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5}, \sqrt{7})$.
\item[(2)]
\begin{align*}
(\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})^{-1}
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5}} \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5}}{(\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5})(\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5})} \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5}}{2} \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{7}),
\end{align*}
Or $\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5} \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{7})$. Thus
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{7}
&= \frac{1}{2} \cdot ((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5}) + (\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5}))
\in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{7}), \\
\sqrt{5}
&= \frac{1}{2} \cdot ((\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5}) - (\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5}))
\in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{7}).
\end{align*}
Thus, $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5}, \sqrt{7}) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{7})$.
\end{enumerate}
By (1)(2), $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5}, \sqrt{7}) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{7})$.
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.9.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.9.}
\emph{If $K$ is an extension of $F$ such that $[K:F]$ is prime,
show that there are no intermediate fields between $K$ and $F$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
Let $L$ be any field such that $F \subseteq L \subseteq K$.
By Proposition 1.20,
$$[K:F] = [K:L][L:F].$$
Since $[K:F]$ is prime, $[K:L] = 1$ or $[L:F] = 1$.
By Problem 1.2, $L=K$ or $L=F$,
or there are no intermediate fields between $K$ and $F$.
$\Box$ \\\\



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\subsubsection*{Problem 1.11.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.11.}
\emph{If $K$ is an algebraic extension of $F$ and if $R$ is a subring of $K$ with
$F \subseteq R \subseteq K$, show that $R$ is a field.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $R$ is a domain since $R$ is contained in a field $K$.
  To show $R$ is a field, it suffices to show that
  every nonzero element $\alpha \in R$ has an inverse in $R$.

\item[(2)]
  Since $\alpha \in R \subseteq K$ is algebraic over $F$,
  there is a minimal polynomial
  \[
    f(x) = b_n x^n + b_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + b_0
  \]
  such that $f(\alpha) = 0$,
  where each $b_i \in F$ and $b_0 \neq 0$ by the minimality of $f$.

\item[(3)]
  Note that
  \begin{align*}
    & \:
    f(\alpha) = 0 \\
    \Longleftrightarrow &\:
    b_n \alpha^n + b_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1} + \cdots + b_0 = 0 \\
    \Longleftrightarrow &\:
    b_n \alpha^n + b_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 \alpha = -b_0 \\
    \Longleftrightarrow &\:
    \alpha(b_n \alpha^{n-1} + b_{n-1} \alpha^{n-2} + \cdots + b_1) = -b_0 \\
    \Longleftrightarrow &\:
    \alpha(\underbrace{(-b_0)^{-1} b_n \alpha^{n-1} + (-b_0)^{-1}b_{n-1} \alpha^{n-2} + \cdots
      + (-b_0)^{-1}b_1}_{:= \alpha'}) = 1.
  \end{align*}
  Hence $\alpha' \in F[\alpha] \subseteq R$.
  Therefore $\alpha'$ is the inverse of $\alpha$ in $R$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.12.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.12.}
\emph{Show that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$
are not isomorphic as fields but are isomorphic as vector spaces over $\mathbb{Q}$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
\emph{Show that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$
are not isomorphic as fields.}
(Reductio ad absurdum)
If $\varphi: \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \to \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$ were an isomorphism
as fields, then $\varphi$ is an identity map on $\mathbb{Q}$, and
\begin{align*}
&\varphi(\sqrt{2}) = a + b\sqrt{3} \text{ for some } a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \\
\Longrightarrow&
\varphi(\sqrt{2})\varphi(\sqrt{2}) = (a + b\sqrt{3})^2 \\
\Longrightarrow&
\varphi(\sqrt{2} \sqrt{2}) = (a + b\sqrt{3})^2 \\
\Longrightarrow&
\varphi(2) = a^2 + 3b^2 + 2ab\sqrt{3} \\
\Longrightarrow&
2 = a^2 + 3b^2 + 2ab\sqrt{3}.
\end{align*}
If $2ab \neq 0$, then $\sqrt{3} = \frac{2-a^2-3b^2}{2ab} \in \mathbb{Q}$,
which is absurd.
Hence $2ab = 0$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  $a = 0$.
  Write $b = \frac{m}{n} \in \mathbb{Q}$ where $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $(m, n) = 1$.
  Hence
  $$2n^2 = 3m^2.$$
  So $2 \mid 3m^2$, $2 \mid m^2$, $2 \mid m$. So $4 \mid 2n^2$, $2 \mid n^2$, $2 \mid n$.
  Hence $2 \mid (m,n)$, contrary to the assumption that $(m,n) = 1$.
  \item[(b)]
  $b = 0$.
  $2 = a^2$.
  Write $a = \frac{m}{n} \in \mathbb{Q}$ where $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $(m, n) = 1$.
  Similar to the argument in (a), we will reach a contradiction.
  \end{enumerate}
By (a)(b), no such isomorphism $\varphi$, that is,
$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$
are not isomorphic as fields.
\item[(2)]
\emph{Show that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$
are isomorphic as $\mathbb{Q}$-vector spaces.}
$[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}):\mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}):\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.
There is a natural map $\varphi: \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \to \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$
defined by $\varphi(a + b\sqrt{2}) = a + b\sqrt{3}$.
Clearly $\varphi$ is well-defined, linear, injective and surjective.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.16.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.16.}
\emph{Let $\mathbb{A}$ be the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{C}$.
Prove that $[\mathbb{A}:\mathbb{Q}] = \infty$. } \\

\emph{Proof (Example 1.16).}
By Example 1.16, $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{2}):\mathbb{Q}] = n.$
Therefore,
$$[\mathbb{A}:\mathbb{Q}]
= [\mathbb{A}:\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{2})][\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{2}):\mathbb{Q}]
= [\mathbb{A}:\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{2})]n$$
for arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.
Hence $[\mathbb{A}:\mathbb{Q}] = \infty$.
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Proof (Example 1.16).}
Given a prime number $p$.
By Example 1.16, $[\mathbb{Q}(\rho):\mathbb{Q}] = p-1$
where $\rho = \exp(2\pi i/p)$.
Therefore,
$$[\mathbb{A}:\mathbb{Q}]
= [\mathbb{A}:\mathbb{Q}(\rho)][\mathbb{Q}(\rho):\mathbb{Q}]
= [\mathbb{A}:\mathbb{Q}(\rho)](p-1)$$
for arbitrary prime $p$.
Hence $[\mathbb{A}:\mathbb{Q}] = \infty$.
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Problem 1.23.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 1.23.}
\emph{Recall that the characteristic of a ring $R$ with identity
is the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $n \cdot 1 = 0$,
if such an $n$ exists, or else the characteristic is $0$.
Let $R$ be a ring with identity.
Define $\varphi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow R$ by $\varphi(n) = n \cdot 1$,
where $1$ is the identity of $R$.
Show that $\varphi$ is a ring homomorphism
and that $\ker(\varphi) = m\mathbb{Z}$ for a unique nonnegative integer $m$,
and show that $m$ is the characteristic of $R$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{$\varphi$ is a ring homomorphism.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    \emph{$\varphi(a+b) = \varphi(a) + \varphi(b)$.}
    $\varphi(a+b)
    = (a+b) \cdot 1
    = a \cdot 1 + b \cdot 1
    = \varphi(a) + \varphi(b)$.
  \item[(b)]
    \emph{$\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a) \varphi(b)$.}
    $\varphi(ab)
    = (ab) \cdot 1
    = (a \cdot 1)(b \cdot 1)
    = \varphi(a) \varphi(b)$
    since $1 \times 1 = 1$. (Here $\times$ is the multiplication operator of $R$.)
  \end{enumerate}
\item[(2)]
  \emph{$\ker(\varphi) = m\mathbb{Z}$ for a unique nonnegative integer $m$.}
  Since $\ker(\varphi)$ is an ideal of a PID $\mathbb{Z}$,
  there is a unique nonnegative integer $m$
  such that $\ker(\varphi) = m\mathbb{Z}$.
\item[(3)]
  \emph{$m$ is the characteristic of $R$.}
  There are only two possible cases,
  $\text{char}(R) = 0$ or else $\text{char}(R) > 0$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    \emph{$\text{char}(R) = 0$.}
    $\ker(\varphi) = 0$. Thus $m = 0 = \text{char}(R)$.
  \item[(b)]
    \emph{$\text{char}(R) = n > 0$.} $n \in \ker(\varphi)$,
    so $m > 0$ and $m \mid n$.
    By the minimality of $n$, $m = n = \text{char}(R)$.

\emph{If $R$ is an integral domain, show that either
$\text{char}(R) = 0$ or $\text{char}(R)$ is prime.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $1$ has infinite order. $\text{char}(R) = 0$. (Nothing to do.)
\item[(2)]
  $1$ has finite order $n$.
  Want to show $n$ is prime.
  If $n = ab$ where $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}^+$,
  then $$0 = n \cdot 1 = (a \cdot 1)(b \cdot 1).$$
  Since $R$ is an integral domain, $a \cdot 1 = $ or $b \cdot 1 = 0$.
  By the minimality of $n$, $a \geq n$ or $b \geq n$.
  $a = n$ or $b = n$. That is, $n$ is prime.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\S 2. Automorphisms}



\subsubsection*{Problem 2.1.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 2.1.}
\emph{Show that the only automorphism of $\mathbb{Q}$ is the identity.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
Given any $\sigma \in \text{Aut}(\mathbb{Q})$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
\emph{Show that $\sigma(1) = 1$.}
Since $1^2 = 1$, $\sigma(1)\sigma(1) = \sigma(1)$. $\sigma(1) = 0$ or $1$.
There are only two possible cases.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  Assume that $\sigma(1) = 0$. So
  $$\sigma(a) = \sigma(a \cdot 1) = \sigma(a)\cdot \sigma(1) = \sigma(a) \cdot 0 = 0$$
  for any $a \in \mathbb{Q}$.
  That is, $\sigma = 0 \in \text{Aut}(\mathbb{Q})$, which is absurd.
  \item[(b)]
  Therefore, $\sigma(1) = 1$.
  \end{enumerate}
\item[(2)]
\emph{Show that $\sigma(n) = n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.}
Write $n = 1 + 1 + \cdots + 1$ ($n$ times $1$).
Applying the additivity of $\sigma$, we have
$$\sigma(n) = \sigma(1) + \sigma(1) + \cdots + \sigma(1) = 1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 = n.$$
(Might use induction on $n$ to eliminate $\cdots$ symbols.)
\item[(3)]
\emph{Show that $\sigma(n) = n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.}
By the additivity of $\sigma$, $\sigma(-n) = -\sigma(n) = -n$ for $n \geq 0$.
The result is established.
\end{enumerate}
For any $a = \frac{n}{m} \in \mathbb{Q}$ ($m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$, $n \neq 0$),
applying the multiplication of $\sigma$ on $am = n$,
that is,
$\sigma(a) \sigma(m) = \sigma(n)$. By (3), we have $\sigma(a)m = n$,
or $$\sigma(a) = \frac{m}{n} = a$$
provided $n \neq 0$,
or $\sigma$ is the identity.
$\Box$ \\\\

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 2.2.}
\emph{Show that the only automorphism of $\mathbb{R}$ is the identity.
(Hint: If $\sigma$ is an automorphism, show that $\sigma|_{\mathbb{Q}} = \text{id}$,
and if $a > 0$, then $\sigma(a) > 0$.
It is an interesting fact that there are infinitely many automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}$,
even thought $[\mathbb{C}:\mathbb{R}] = 2$.
Why is this fact not a contradiction to this problem?)} \\

\emph{Proof (Hint).}
Given any $\sigma \in \text{Aut}(\mathbb{R})$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
Apply the same argument in Problem 2.1, we have $\sigma|_{\mathbb{Q}} = \text{id}$.
Notice that $\sigma(a) \neq 0$ for any $a \neq 0$.
\item[(2)]
\emph{Show that $\sigma(a) > 0$ if $a > 0$.}
Given any $a > 0$.
Write $a = \sqrt{a}\sqrt{a}$ (well-defined) and then apply
$\sigma$ on the both sides,
$$\sigma(a) = \sigma(\sqrt{a})\sigma(\sqrt{a}) = \sigma(\sqrt{a})^2 > 0$$
(since $\sqrt{a} \neq 0$ and thus $\sigma(\sqrt{a})$ cannot be zero).
\item[(3)]
\emph{Show that $\sigma(a) > \sigma(b)$ if $a > b$.}
It is a corollary to (2) by applying $\sigma$ on $a - b > 0$.
($\sigma(a - b) > 0$, or $\sigma(a) - \sigma(b) > 0$, or $\sigma(a) > \sigma(b)$.)
\item[(4)]
For any real number $x \in \mathbb{R}$,
choose two sequences $\{p_n\}, \{q_n\}$ of rational numbers
such that $p_n < x < q_n$ and $p_n, q_n \to x$ as $n \to \infty$.
Take $\sigma$ on the inequality, $\sigma(p_n) < \sigma(x) < \sigma(q_n)$.
So $p_n < \sigma(x) < q_n$ since $\sigma|_{\mathbb{Q}} = \text{id}$.
Let $n \to \infty$, we get $x \leq \sigma(x) \leq x$, or $\sigma(x) = x$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Corollary 10.4 (Cohomological Hilbert Theorem 90).
  Let $K$ be a cyclic Galois extension of $F$.
  Then $H^{1}(\mathrm{Gal}(K/F), K^{\times}) = 0$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{(Exercise 10.24 in the textbook:
  Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis, 3rd edition.)
  Let $\omega = \sum a_i(\mathbf{x}) dx_i$ be a $1$-form of class $\mathcal{C}''$
  in a convex open set $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$.
  Assume $d\omega = 0$ and prove that $\omega$ is exact in $E$.}
  Hence the first de Rham cohomology $H^{1}_{\mathrm{dR}}(E) = 0$.

\item[(3)]
  $H^{1}_{\mathrm{dR}}(E) = 0$ if $E$ is simply connected.
  (The converse is not true.)

\item[(4)]
  \emph{(Exercise 10.21 in the textbook:
  Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis, 3rd edition.)
  Consider the $1$-form
  \[
    \eta = \frac{x dy - y dx}{x^2+y^2}
  \]
  in $\mathbb{R}^2-\{\mathbf{0}\}$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    \emph{Carry out the computation that leads to
    \[
      \int_{\gamma} \eta = 2\pi \neq 0,
    \]
    and prove that $d\eta = 0$.}

  \item[(b)]
    \emph{Let $\gamma(t) = (r \cos t, r \sin t)$, for some $r > 0$,
    and let $\Gamma$ be a $\mathcal{C}''$-curve in $\mathbb{R}^2 - \{\mathbf{0}\}$,
    with parameter interval $[0,2\pi]$,
    with $\Gamma(0) = \Gamma(2\pi)$,
    such that the intervals $[\gamma(t),\Gamma(t)]$ do not contain $\mathbf{0}$
    for any $t \in [0,2\pi]$.
    Prove that
    \[
      \int_{\Gamma} \eta = 2\pi.
    \]}

  \item[(c)]
    \emph{Take $\Gamma(t) = (a\cos t, b\sin t)$ where $a > 0$, $b > 0$ are fixed.
    Show that}
    \[
      \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{ab}{a^2\cos^2 t + b^2 \sin^2 t}dt = 2\pi.
    \]

  \item[(d)]
    \emph{Show that
    \[
      \eta = d\left( \arctan\frac{y}{x} \right)
    \]
    in any convex open set in which $x \neq 0$, and that
    \[
      \eta = d\left( -\arctan\frac{x}{y} \right)
    \]
    in any convex open set in which $y \neq 0$.
    Explain why this justifies the notation $\eta = d\theta$,
    in spite of the fact that $\eta$ is not exact in $\mathbb{R}^2 - \{0\}$.}
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(5)]
  \emph{(Exercise 10.22 in the textbook:
  Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis, 3rd edition.)
  Define $\zeta$ in $\mathbb{R}^3-\{\mathbf{0}\}$ by
  \[
    \zeta = \frac{x dy \wedge dz + y dz \wedge dx + z dx \wedge dy}{r^3}
  \]
  where $r = (x^2+y^2+z^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}$,
  let $D$ be the rectangle given by $0 \leq u \leq \pi$, $0 \leq v \leq 2\pi$,
  and let $\Sigma$ be the $2$-surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$,
  with parameter domain $D$, given by
  \[
    x = \sin u \cos v,
    \qquad
    y = \sin u \sin v,
    \qquad
    z = \cos u.
  \]}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    \emph{Prove that $d\zeta = 0$ in $\mathbb{R}^3 - \{ \mathbf{0} \}$.}

  \item[(b)]
    \emph{Let $S$ denote the restriction of $\Sigma$ to a parameter domain $E \subseteq D$.
    Prove that
    \[
      \int_{S} \zeta
      = \int_{E} \sin u \: du \: dv
      = A(S),
    \]
    where $A$ denotes area, as in Section 10.46.
    Note that this contains
    \[
      \int_{\Sigma} \zeta
      = \int_{D} \sin u \: du \: dv
      = 4\pi \neq 0
    \]
    as a special case.}

  \item[(c)]
    \emph{Suppose $g, h_1, h_2, h_3$, are $\mathcal{C}''$-functions on $[0,1]$, $g > 0$.
    Let $(x,y,z) = \Phi(s,t)$ define a $2$-surface $\Phi$,
    with parameter domain $I^2$, by
    \[
      x = g(t)h_1(s),
      \qquad
      y = g(t)h_2(s),
      \qquad
      z = g(t)h_3(s).
    \]
    Prove that
    \[
      \int_{\Phi} \zeta = 0.
    \]
    Note the shape of the range of $\Phi$:
    For fixed $s$, $\Phi(s,t)$ runs over an interval on a line through $\mathbf{0}$.
    The range of $\Phi$ thus lies in a ``cone'' with vertex at the origin.}

  \item[(d)]
    \emph{Let $E$ be a closed rectangle in $D$, with edges parallel to those of $D$.
    Suppose $f \in \mathcal{C}''(D)$, $f > 0$.
    Let $\Omega$ be the $2$-surface with parameter domain $E$,
    defined by
    \[
      \Omega(u,v) = f(u,v)\Sigma(u,v).
    \]
    Define $S$ as in (b) and prove that}
    \[
      \int_{\Omega} \zeta = \int_{S} \zeta = A(S).
    \]

  \item[(e)]
    \emph{Put $\lambda = -\frac{z}{r}\eta$, where
    \[
      \eta = \frac{xdy-ydx}{x^2+y^2}.
    \]
    Then $\lambda$ is a $1$-form in the open set $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ in which $x^2+y^2 > 0$.
    Show that $\zeta$ is exact in $V$ by showing that}
    \[
      \zeta = d\lambda.
    \]

  \item[(f)]
    \emph{Is $\zeta$ exact in the complement of every line through the origin?}
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(6)]
  \emph{(Exercise 10.23 in the textbook:
  Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis, 3rd edition.)
Fix $n$.
Define $r_k = (x_1^2+\cdots+x_k^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ for $1 \leq k \leq n$,
let $E_k$ be the set of all $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ at which $r_k > 0$,
and let $\omega_k$ be the $(k-1)$-form defined in $E_k$ by
\[
  \omega_k
  = (r_k)^{-k}
    \sum_{i=1}^{k} (-1)^{i-1} x_i
    dx_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{dx_i} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_k
\]
Note that $\omega_2 = \eta$, $\omega_3 = \zeta$ in the terminology of
Exercise 10.21 and Exercise 10.22.
Note also that}
\[
  E_1 \subseteq E_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq E_n = \mathbb{R}^n.

  where}
  \[
    g_k(t) = \int_{-1}^{t} (1-s^2)^{\frac{k-3}{2}} ds

\subsubsection*{Problem 10.1.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Problem 10.1.}
\emph{Let $M$ be a $G$-module.
Show that the boundary map $\delta_n: C^{n}(G,M) \to C^{n+1}(G,M)$
defined in this section is a homomorphism.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $\delta_n$ is defined by
  \begin{align*}
    \delta_n(f)(\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_{n+1})
    = & \:
    \sigma_1 f(\sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_{n+1}) \\

    & + (-1)^{n+1} f(\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_{n})
  \end{align*}
  if $n > 0$.
  If $n = 0$, then the map $\delta_0: M = C^{0}(G,M) \to C^{1}(G,M)$ is defined by
  $\delta_0(m)(\sigma) = \sigma m - m$.

\item[(2)]
  It suffices to show that $\delta_n(f + g) = \delta_n(f) + \delta_n(g)$
  for all $n$ and all $n$-cochains $f$ and $g$.

\item[(3)]
  If $n = 0$, then

    \delta_0(f + g)(\sigma)
    &= \sigma (f + g) - (f + g) \\
    &= \sigma f + \sigma g - f - g

      &(\text{$M$: abelian group}) \\
    &= \delta_0(f) + \delta_0(g).

    & \:
    \delta_n(f + g)(\sigma) \\
    = & \:
    \sigma_1 (f + g)(\sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_{n+1})
    + \sum_{i=1}^{n} (-1)^{i}
        (f + g)(\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_i \sigma_{i+1}, \ldots, \sigma_{n+1}) \\

        g(\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_i \sigma_{i+1}, \ldots, \sigma_{n+1}) \\
    & + (-1)^{n+1} f(\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_{n}) + (-1)^{n+1} g(\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_{n}) \\
    = & \:
    \Bigg\{ \sigma_1 f(\sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_{n+1}) + \sum_{i=1}^{n} (-1)^{i}
        f(\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_i \sigma_{i+1}, \ldots, \sigma_{n+1}) \\

    \delta_n(f)(\sigma) + \delta_n(g)(\sigma).
