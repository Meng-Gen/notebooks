\emph{If $k \geq 2$ and $\tau \in H$ prove that the Eisenstein series
\[
  G_{2k}(\tau)
  = \sum_{(m,n) \neq (0,0)} (m+n\tau)^{-2k}
\]
has the Fourier expansion
}
\[
  G_{2k}(\tau)
  =
  2 \zeta(2k) + \frac{2(2\pi i)^{2k}}{(2k-1)!} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sigma_{2k-1}(n) e^{2\pi i n \tau}.
\] \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Similar to Lemma 1.3 on page 19, we have
  \[
    (2k-1)! \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{1}{(\tau+m)^{2k}}
    = (2 \pi i)^{2k} \sum_{r=1}^{\infty} r^{2k-1} e^{2 \pi i r \tau}.
  \]

\item[(2)]
  Similar to Theorem 1.18, we have
  \begin{align*}
    G_{2k}(\tau)
    &= \sum_{(m,n) \neq (0,0)} (m+n\tau)^{-2k} \\
    &= \sum_{\substack{m=-\infty \\ m \neq 0 (n = 0)}}^{+\infty} m^{-2k}
      + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} ((m+n\tau)^{-2k} + (m-n\tau)^{-2k}) \\
    &= 2 \zeta(2k)
      + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty} (m+n\tau)^{-2k} \\
    &= 2 \zeta(2k)
      + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(2\pi i)^{2k}}{(2k-1)!}
        \sum_{r=1}^{\infty} r^{2k-1} e^{2\pi i nr \tau} \\
    &= 2 \zeta(2k)
      + \frac{2(2\pi i)^{2k}}{(2k-1)!} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
        \underbrace{\sum_{d|n} d^{2k-1}}_{= \sigma_{2k-1}(n)} e^{2\pi i n \tau}.
  \end{align*}
  In the last double sum we collect together those terms for which $nr$ is constant.
\end{enumerate}
