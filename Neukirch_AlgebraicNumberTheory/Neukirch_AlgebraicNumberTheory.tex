\subsubsection*{Exercise I.1.1.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.1.1.}
\emph{$\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unit if and only if $N(\alpha) = 1$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{$(\Longrightarrow)$}
  Since $\alpha$ is a unit, there is $\beta \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that
  $\alpha \beta = 1$.
  So $N(\alpha \beta) = N(1)$, or $N(\alpha) N(\beta) = 1$.
  Since the image of $N$ is nonnegative integers, $N(\alpha) = 1$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{$(\Longleftarrow)$}
  $N(\alpha) = \alpha \overline{\alpha}$,
  or $1 = \alpha \overline{\alpha}$ since $N(\alpha) = 1$.
  That is, $\overline{\alpha} \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ is
  the inverse of $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$.
  (Or we solve the equation $N(\alpha) = a^2 + b^2 = 1$,
  and show that all four solutions ($\pm 1$ and $\pm i$) are units.)

\item[(3)]
  Conclusion: a unit $\alpha = a+bi$ of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$
  is satisfying the equation $N(\alpha) = a^2 + b^2 = 1$ by (1)(2).
  That is, the only unit of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ are $\pm 1$ and $\pm i$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.1.4.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.1.4.}
\emph{Show that the ring $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ cannot be ordered.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
  Similar to the fact that $i$ cannot be ordered in $\mathbb{C}$,
  $i$ cannot be ordered in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ either.
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.1.5.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.1.5.}
\emph{Show that the only units of the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-d}] = \mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z}\sqrt{-d}$,
for any rational integer $d > 1$, are $\pm 1$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Define the norm $N$ on $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-d}]$ by
  \[
    N(x+y\sqrt{-d}) = (x+y\sqrt{-d})(x-y\sqrt{-d}) = x^2 + y^2 d,
  \]
  i.e., by $N(z) = |z|^2$.
  It is multiplicative.

\item[(2)]
  Similar to Exercise I.1.1,
  \begin{align*}
    \text{$x+y\sqrt{-d} \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-d}]$ is a unit}
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    N(x+y\sqrt{-d}) = x^2 + y^2 d = 1 \\
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    x^2 = 1 \text{ and } y = 0 \\
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    x = \pm 1 \text{ and } y = 0.
  \end{align*}
  Hence the only units of the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-d}]$ are $\pm 1$ ($d > 1$).
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.2.1.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.2.1.}
\emph{Is $\frac{3+2\sqrt{6}}{1-\sqrt{6}}$ an algebraic integer?} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $\alpha := \frac{3+2\sqrt{6}}{1-\sqrt{6}} = -3-\sqrt{6}$.
  Since the set of all algebraic integers is a ring,
  $\alpha$ is an algebraic integer.

\item[(2)]
  Or show that $\alpha$ satisfies a monic equation $x^2 + 6x + 3 = 0 \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.2.4.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.2.4.}
\emph{Let $D$ be a squarefree rational integer $\neq 0, 1$ and
$d$ the discriminant of the quadratic number field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$.
Show that
\begin{equation*}
  d = \begin{cases}
    D  & \text{if $D \equiv 1 \pmod 4$,}\\
    4D & \text{if $D \equiv 2, 3 \pmod 4$.}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
and that an integral basis of $K$ is given by $\{1, \sqrt{D}\}$ in the second case,
by $\left\{ 1, \frac{1+\sqrt{D}}{2} \right\}$ in the first case,
and by $\left\{ 1, \frac{d+\sqrt{d}}{2} \right\}$ in both case.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  The Galois group of $K|\mathbb{Q}$ has two elements, the identity
  and an automorphism sending $\sqrt{D}$ to $-\sqrt{D}$.

\item[(2)]
  Note that $\alpha \in \mathcal{O}_K$
  iff $\mathrm{Tr}_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha), N_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) \in \mathbb{Z}$
  (by noting that the equation
  $x^2 - \mathrm{Tr}_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) x + N_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) = 0$ has
  a root $x = \alpha$).
  So given $\alpha = x + y \sqrt{D} \in \mathcal{O}_K$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    \mathrm{Tr}_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) &= 2x \in \mathbb{Z}, \\
    N_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) &= x^2 - D y^2 \in \mathbb{Z}.
  \end{align*}

\item[(3)]
  So $4(x^2 - D y^2) = (2x)^2 - D(2y)^2 \in \mathbb{Z}$.
  So $D(2y)^2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ since $2x \in \mathbb{Z}$.
  So $2y \in \mathbb{Z}$ since $D$ is squarefree $\neq 0, 1$.
  Let $r = 2x, s = 2y$.
  Then $r^2 - Ds^2 \equiv 0 \pmod 4$.
  Note that a square $\equiv 0, 1 \pmod 4$.

\item[(4)]
  If $D \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, then
  \begin{align*}
    &\:r^2 - Ds^2 \equiv r^2 - s^2 \pmod 4 \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \text{$r$ and $s$ has the same parity} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \mathcal{O}_K = \left\{ \frac{r+s\sqrt{D}}{2} : r \equiv s \pmod 2 \right\} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \mathcal{O}_K = \left\{ \frac{r-s}{2} + s \cdot \frac{1+\sqrt{D}}{2}
      : r \equiv s \pmod 2 \right\} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z} \frac{1+\sqrt{D}}{2}.
  \end{align*}
  So $\left\{ 1, \frac{1+\sqrt{D}}{2} \right\}$ is an integral basis of $K$.
  Hence
  \[
    d
    =
    \begin{vmatrix}
      1 & \frac{1+\sqrt{D}}{2} \\
      1 & \frac{1-\sqrt{D}}{2}
    \end{vmatrix}^2
    = D.
  \]

\item[(5)]
  If $D \equiv 2, 3 \pmod 4$, then
  \begin{align*}
    &\:r^2 - Ds^2 \equiv r^2+2s^2 \text{ or } r^2+s^2 \pmod 4 \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \text{both $r$ and $s$ are even} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \text{both $x$ and $y$ are rational integers} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z}\sqrt{D}.
  \end{align*}
  So $\{ 1, \sqrt{D} \}$ is an integral basis of $K$.
  Hence
  \[
    d
    =
    \begin{vmatrix}
      1 & \sqrt{D} \\
      1 & -\sqrt{D}
    \end{vmatrix}^2
    = 4D.
  \]

\item[(6)]
  By (4)(5),
  $\left\{ 1, \frac{d+\sqrt{d}}{2} \right\}$ is an integral basis of $K$
  for any case.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.2.7. (Stickelberger's discriminant relation)}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.2.7. (Stickelberger's discriminant relation)}
\emph{The discriminant $d_K$ of an algebraic number field $K$ is always
$\equiv 0 \pmod 4$ or $\equiv 1 \pmod 4$.
(Hint: The discriminant $\det(\sigma_i \omega_j)$ of an integral basis $\omega_j$
is a sum of terms, each prefixed by a positive or a negative sign.
Writing $P$ (resp. $N$) for the sum of the positive (resp. negative) terms,
one find $d_K = (P-N)^2 = (P+N)^2 - 4PN$.)} \\



\emph{Proof (Hint).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $S_n$ be the symmetric group of degree $n$, and
  $A_n$ be the alternating group of degree $n$.
  So
  \begin{align*}
    \det(\sigma_i \omega_j)
    &= \sum_{\pi \in S_n}
      \left( \mathrm{sgn}(\pi) \prod_{i=1}^{n} \sigma_i \omega_{\pi(i)} \right) \\
    &= \underbrace{\sum_{\pi \in A_n} \prod_{i=1}^{n} \sigma_i \omega_{\pi(i)}}_{:= P}
      - \underbrace{\sum_{\pi \in S_n - A_n} \prod_{i=1}^{n} \sigma_i \omega_{\pi(i)}}_{:= N}.
  \end{align*}

\item[(2)]
  Note that $\sigma_i(P+N) = P+N$ and $\sigma_i(PN) = PN$ for all $\sigma_i$.
  Hence $P+N, PN \in \mathbb{Q}$.
  Therefore $P+N, PN \in \mathbb{Q} \cap \mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z}$.

\item[(3)]
  By (1)(2),
  \begin{align*}
    d_K
    &= \det(\sigma_i \omega_j)^2 \\
    &= (P-N)^2 \\
    &= (P+N)^2 - 4PN \\
    &\equiv 0, 1 \pmod 4.
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\
