\subsubsection*{Exercise I.1.1.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.1.1.}
\emph{$\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unit if and only if $N(\alpha) = 1$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{$(\Longrightarrow)$}
  Since $\alpha$ is a unit, there is $\beta \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that
  $\alpha \beta = 1$.
  So $N(\alpha \beta) = N(1)$, or $N(\alpha) N(\beta) = 1$.
  Since the image of $N$ is nonnegative integers, $N(\alpha) = 1$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{$(\Longleftarrow)$}
  $N(\alpha) = \alpha \overline{\alpha}$,
  or $1 = \alpha \overline{\alpha}$ since $N(\alpha) = 1$.
  That is, $\overline{\alpha} \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ is
  the inverse of $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$.
  (Or we solve the equation $N(\alpha) = a^2 + b^2 = 1$,
  and show that all four solutions ($\pm 1$ and $\pm i$) are units.)

\item[(3)]
  Conclusion: a unit $\alpha = a+bi$ of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$
  is satisfying the equation $N(\alpha) = a^2 + b^2 = 1$ by (1)(2).
  That is, the only unit of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ are $\pm 1$ and $\pm i$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.1.4.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.1.4.}
\emph{Show that the ring $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ cannot be ordered.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
  Similar to the fact that $i$ cannot be ordered in $\mathbb{C}$.
  Thus $i$ cannot be ordered in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ either.
$\Box$ \\\\



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\subsubsection*{Exercise I.1.5.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.1.5.}
\emph{Show that the only units of the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-d}] = \mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z}\sqrt{-d}$,
for any rational integer $d > 1$, are $\pm 1$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Define the norm $N$ on $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-d}]$ by
  \[
    N(x+y\sqrt{-d}) = (x+y\sqrt{-d})(x-y\sqrt{-d}) = x^2 + y^2 d,
  \]
  i.e., by $N(z) = |z|^2$.
  It is multiplicative.

\item[(2)]
  Similar to Exercise I.1.1,
  \begin{align*}
    \text{$x+y\sqrt{-d} \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-d}]$ is a unit}
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    N(x+y\sqrt{-d}) = x^2 + y^2 d = 1 \\
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    x^2 = 1 \text{ and } y = 0 \\
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    x = \pm 1 \text{ and } y = 0.
  \end{align*}
  Hence the only units of the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-d}]$ are $\pm 1$ ($d > 1$).
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.2.1.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.2.1.}
\emph{Is $\frac{3+2\sqrt{6}}{1-\sqrt{6}}$ an algebraic integer?} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $\alpha := \frac{3+2\sqrt{6}}{1-\sqrt{6}} = -3-\sqrt{6}$.
  Since the set of all algebraic integers is a ring,
  $\alpha$ is an algebraic integer.

\item[(2)]
  Or show that $\alpha$ satisfies a monic equation $x^2 + 6x + 3 = 0 \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.2.2.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.2.2.}
\emph{Show that, if the integral domain $A$ is integrally closed,
then so is the polynomial ring $A[t]$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Suppose $A$ is integrally closed in $B$.
  Show that $A[t]$ is integrally closed in $B[t]$.}
  Suppose $f \in B[t]$ is integral over $A[t]$.
  Write
  \[
    f^n + g_1 f^{n-1} + \cdots + g_{n-1} f + g_n = 0 
  \]
  where $n > 0$ and $g_i \in A[t]$.
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    &\:
    f^n + g_1 f^{n-1} + \cdots + g_{n-1} f = -g_n \in A[t] \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    f(\underbrace{f^{n-1} + g_1 f^{n-1} + \cdots + g_{n-1}}_{:= g}) \in A[t].
  \end{align*}
  It is possible to show that $fg \in A[t]$ implies that $f \in A[t]$ and $g \in A[t]$
  by using the fact that $A$ is integrally closed in $B$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Suppose $f, g$ are monic polynomials in $B[t]$.
  Show that $fg \in A[t]$ implies that $f \in A[t]$ and $g \in A[t]$.}
  Write
  \[
    f = \prod (t - \xi_i),
    \qquad
    g = \prod (t - \eta_j)
  \]
  in some splitting field $F$ of $f$ and $g$ containing the quotient field of $B$.
  Note that each $\xi_i$ and each $\eta_j$ is a root of a monic equation $fg$ in $A[t]$.
  Since $A$ is integrally closed in $B$, $\xi_i, \eta_j \in A$.
  Hence $f, g \in A[t]$.

\item[(3)]
  To apply part (2), we need to remedy leading coefficients of $f$ and $g$.
  Take an integer $m > \max\{\deg(f), \deg(g_1), \ldots, \deg(g_n) \}$.
  Let $f_0 = t^m + f$ be a monic polynomial in $B[t]$.
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    &\:
    (f_0 - t^m)^n + g_1 (f_0 - t^m)^{n-1} + \cdots + g_n = 0 \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    f_0^n + h_1 f_0^{n-1} + \cdots + h_n = 0
  \end{align*}
  where
  \[
    h_n = t^{mn} + (-1)^{n-1} g_1 t^{m(n-1)} + \cdots + g_n \in A[t]
  \]
  is also monic.
  So
  \begin{align*}
    &\:
    f_0^n + h_1 f_0^{n-1} + \cdots + h_{n-1} f = -h_n \text{ is monic in } A[t] \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    f_0(\underbrace{f_0^{n-1} + h_1 f^{n-1} + \cdots + h_{n-1}}_{:= h_0}) \in A[t] \text{ where } \\
    &\: \text{$f_0$ and $h_0$ both are monic in } B[t].
  \end{align*}
  Now we can apply part (2) safely.

\item[(4)]
  In part (1), we let $B$ be the quotient field of $A$
  and thus the quotient field of $A[t]$ is $B(t)$.
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    &\:
    \text{$f \in B(t)$ integral over $A[t]$} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \text{$f \in B(t)$ integral over $B[t]$}
      &(A[t] \subseteq B[t]) \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    f \in B[t]
      &(\text{$B[t]$ is a UFD}) \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \text{$f \in B[t]$ integral over $A[t]$} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    f \in A[t].
      &((1))
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.2.3.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.2.3.}
\emph{In the polynomial ring $A = \mathbb{Q}[x,y]$,
consider the principal ideal $\mathfrak{p} = (x^2-y^3)$.
Show that $\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal,
but $A/\mathfrak{p}$ is not integrally closed.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  It is easy to show that $x^2-y^3$ is irreducible in $A$.
  Hence $\mathfrak{p} = (x^2-y^3)$ is prime since $A$ is a UFD.

\item[(2)]
  By substituting $x = t^3$, $y = t^2$,
  $A/\mathfrak{p} \cong \mathbb{Q}[t^3,t^2]$,
  with quotient field $\mathbb{Q}(t)$ (by noting $t = \frac{x}{y}$).
  Note that $\mathbb{Q}[t]$ is a UFD, thus is already integrally closed.
  So the integral closure will be $\mathbb{Q}[t] \supsetneq \mathbb{Q}[t^3,t^2]$.
  It suggests that $A/\mathfrak{p}$ might not be integrally closed.

\item[(3)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  If not, then the element $\frac{x}{y}$ satisfies a monic equation
  $t^2 - y = 0 \in (A/\mathfrak{p})[t]$.
  So $\frac{x}{y} \in A/\mathfrak{p}$ or $t \in \mathbb{Q}[t^3,t^2]$, which is absurd.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Note.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Serre's criterion for normality.

\item[(2)]
  Hence smoothness is the same as normality for affine curves in $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$.
  Note that $x^2-y^3$ is an irreducible cubic with a cusp at the origin $(0,0)$.

\item[(3)]
  There is an affine variety $X \in \mathbb{Q}[x,y,z]$ such that
  $X$ is normal but not smooth.
  ($X = V(x^2 + y^2 - z^2)$ for example.) \\\\
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.2.4.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.2.4.}
\emph{Let $D$ be a squarefree rational integer $\neq 0, 1$ and
$d$ the discriminant of the quadratic number field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$.
Show that
\begin{equation*}
  d = \begin{cases}
    D  & \text{if $D \equiv 1 \pmod 4$,}\\
    4D & \text{if $D \equiv 2, 3 \pmod 4$.}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
and that an integral basis of $K$ is given by $\{1, \sqrt{D}\}$ in the second case,
by $\left\{ 1, \frac{1+\sqrt{D}}{2} \right\}$ in the first case,
and by $\left\{ 1, \frac{d+\sqrt{d}}{2} \right\}$ in both case.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  The Galois group of $K|\mathbb{Q}$ has two elements, the identity
  and an automorphism sending $\sqrt{D}$ to $-\sqrt{D}$.

\item[(2)]
  Note that $\alpha \in \mathcal{O}_K$
  iff $\mathrm{Tr}_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha), N_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) \in \mathbb{Z}$
  (by noting that the equation
  $x^2 - \mathrm{Tr}_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) x + N_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) = 0$ has
  a root $x = \alpha$).
  So given $\alpha = x + y \sqrt{D} \in \mathcal{O}_K$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    \mathrm{Tr}_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) &= 2x \in \mathbb{Z}, \\
    N_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) &= x^2 - D y^2 \in \mathbb{Z}.
  \end{align*}

\item[(3)]
  So $4(x^2 - D y^2) = (2x)^2 - D(2y)^2 \in \mathbb{Z}$.
  So $D(2y)^2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ since $2x \in \mathbb{Z}$.
  So $2y \in \mathbb{Z}$ since $D$ is squarefree $\neq 0, 1$.
  Let $r = 2x, s = 2y$.
  Then $r^2 - Ds^2 \equiv 0 \pmod 4$.
  Note that a square $\equiv 0, 1 \pmod 4$.

\item[(4)]
  If $D \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, then
  \begin{align*}
    &\:r^2 - Ds^2 \equiv r^2 - s^2 \pmod 4 \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \text{$r$ and $s$ has the same parity} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \mathcal{O}_K = \left\{ \frac{r+s\sqrt{D}}{2} : r \equiv s \pmod 2 \right\} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \mathcal{O}_K = \left\{ \frac{r-s}{2} + s \cdot \frac{1+\sqrt{D}}{2}
      : r \equiv s \pmod 2 \right\} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z} \frac{1+\sqrt{D}}{2}.
  \end{align*}
  So $\left\{ 1, \frac{1+\sqrt{D}}{2} \right\}$ is an integral basis of $K$.
  Hence
  \[
    d
    =
    \begin{vmatrix}
      1 & \frac{1+\sqrt{D}}{2} \\
      1 & \frac{1-\sqrt{D}}{2}
    \end{vmatrix}^2
    = D.
  \]

\item[(5)]
  If $D \equiv 2, 3 \pmod 4$, then
  \begin{align*}
    &\:r^2 - Ds^2 \equiv r^2+2s^2 \text{ or } r^2+s^2 \pmod 4 \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \text{both $r$ and $s$ are even} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \text{both $x$ and $y$ are rational integers} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z}\sqrt{D}.
  \end{align*}
  So $\{ 1, \sqrt{D} \}$ is an integral basis of $K$.
  Hence
  \[
    d
    =
    \begin{vmatrix}
      1 & \sqrt{D} \\
      1 & -\sqrt{D}
    \end{vmatrix}^2
    = 4D.
  \]

\item[(6)]
  By (4)(5),
  $\left\{ 1, \frac{d+\sqrt{d}}{2} \right\}$ is an integral basis of $K$
  for any case.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.2.7. (Stickelberger's discriminant relation)}
\emph{The discriminant $d_K$ of an algebraic number field $K$ is always
$\equiv 0 \pmod 4$ or $\equiv 1 \pmod 4$.
(Hint: The discriminant $\det(\sigma_i \omega_j)$ of an integral basis $\omega_j$
is a sum of terms, each prefixed by a positive or a negative sign.
Writing $P$ (resp. $N$) for the sum of the positive (resp. negative) terms,
one find $d_K = (P-N)^2 = (P+N)^2 - 4PN$.)} \\



\emph{Proof (Hint).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $S_n$ be the symmetric group of degree $n$, and
  $A_n$ be the alternating group of degree $n$.
  So
  \begin{align*}
    \det(\sigma_i \omega_j)
    &= \sum_{\pi \in S_n}
      \left( \mathrm{sgn}(\pi) \prod_{i=1}^{n} \sigma_i \omega_{\pi(i)} \right) \\
    &= \underbrace{\sum_{\pi \in A_n} \prod_{i=1}^{n} \sigma_i \omega_{\pi(i)}}_{:= P}
      - \underbrace{\sum_{\pi \in S_n - A_n} \prod_{i=1}^{n} \sigma_i \omega_{\pi(i)}}_{:= N}.
  \end{align*}

\item[(2)]
  Note that $\sigma_i(P+N) = P+N$ and $\sigma_i(PN) = PN$ for all $\sigma_i$.
  Hence $P+N, PN \in \mathbb{Q}$.
  Therefore $P+N, PN \in \mathbb{Q} \cap \mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z}$.

\item[(3)]
  By (1)(2),
  \begin{align*}
    d_K
    &= \det(\sigma_i \omega_j)^2 \\
    &= (P-N)^2 \\
    &= (P+N)^2 - 4PN \\
    &\equiv 0, 1 \pmod 4.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.3.4.}
\emph{A Dedekind domain with a finite number of prime ideals is a principal ideal domain.
(Hint: If $\mathfrak{a} = \mathfrak{p}_{1}^{\nu_1} \cdots \mathfrak{p}_{r}^{\nu_r} \neq 0$
is an ideal, then choose elements
$\pi_i \in \mathfrak{p}_{i} \smallsetminus \mathfrak{p}_{i}^2$
and apply the Chinese remainder theorem for the cosets
$\pi_i^{\nu_i} \pmod{\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{\nu_i+1}}$.)} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  The hint gives all.

\item[(2)]
  The existence of $\pi_i$ is guaranteed by Theorem I.3.3 (the unique prime factorization).
  The Chinese remainder theorem shows that there is one element $\pi \in \mathcal{O}$
  such that $\pi = \pi_i^{\nu_i} \pmod{\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{\nu_i+1}}$ for each $i$.

\item[(3)]
  Hence $\mathfrak{p} = (\pi)$ since they have the same prime factorization.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.3.5.}
\emph{The quotient ring $\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{a}$ of a Dedekind domain by
an ideal $\mathfrak{a} \neq 0$ is a principal ideal domain.
(Hint: For $\mathfrak{a} = \mathfrak{p}^n$ the only proper ideals of $\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{a}$
are given by $\mathfrak{p}/\mathfrak{p}^n, \ldots, \mathfrak{p}^{n-1}/\mathfrak{p}^n$.
Choose $\pi \in \mathfrak{p} \smallsetminus \mathfrak{p}^2$
and show that $\mathfrak{p}^{\nu} = \mathcal{O}\pi^{\nu} + \mathfrak{p}^n$.)} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  By the Chinese remainder theorem,
  it suffices to show the case $\mathfrak{a} = \mathfrak{p}^n$ where $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime.

\item[(2)]
  There is a natural correspondence between
  \[
    \{ \text{ideals of $\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{p}^n$} \}
    \longleftrightarrow
    \{ \text{ideals of $\mathcal{O}$ containing $\mathfrak{p}^n$} \}.
  \]
  Hence the proper ideals of $\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{p}^n$
  are given by $\mathfrak{p}/\mathfrak{p}^n, \ldots, \mathfrak{p}^{n-1}/\mathfrak{p}^n$.

\item[(3)]
  Similar to Exercise I.3.4,
  choose $\pi \in \mathfrak{p} \smallsetminus \mathfrak{p}^2$
  and thus $\mathfrak{p}^{\nu} = \mathcal{O}\pi^{\nu} + \mathfrak{p}^n$
  ($\nu = 1, \ldots, n-1$)
  since they have the same prime factorization.
  Hence
  $\mathfrak{p}^{\nu}/\mathfrak{p}^n = (\pi^{\nu} + \mathfrak{p}^n)$ is principal.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Given an ideal $\mathfrak{a} \neq 0$  of a Dedekind domain $\mathcal{O}$.
  (Nothing to do if $\mathfrak{a} = 0 = (0)$.)
  So $\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{a}$ is a principal ideal domain (Exercise I.3.5).

\item[(2)]
  Take any $\alpha \in \mathfrak{a} \smallsetminus \{0\}$.
  So
  $(\alpha)/\mathfrak{a} = (\beta \pmod{\mathfrak{a}})$ is a principal ideal

\item[(1)]
  ($\Longrightarrow$)
  Define a natural homeomorphism
  $\varphi: \mathbb{R}^n/\Gamma \to \mathbb{S}^1 \times \cdots \times \mathbb{S}^1$

  Note that $\mathbb{S}^1 \times \cdots \times \mathbb{S}^1$ is compact.

\item[(2)]
  ($\Longleftarrow$)
  Let $V_0$ be the linear subspace of $V$ which is spanned by the set $\Gamma$.
  Since the vector space $V/V_0$ is contained in a compact set $V/\Gamma$,
  \[
    \dim(V/V_0) = 0

\emph{Show that Minkowski's lattice point theorem cannot be improved,
by giving an example of a centrally symmetric convex set $X \subset V$ such that
$\mathrm{vol}(X) = 2^n \mathrm{vol}(\Gamma)$
which does not contain any nonzero point of the lattice $\Gamma$.
If $X$ is compact, however,
then the statement $\mathrm{vol}(X) > 2^n \mathrm{vol}(\Gamma)$ does remain true
in the case of equality.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $V = \mathbb{R}^n$, $\Gamma = \mathbb{Z}^n$ be a complete lattice in $V$, and
  $X = (-1,1)^n \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a centrally symmetric convex set in $V$.
  Hence $\mathrm{vol}(X) = 2^n \mathrm{vol}(\Gamma)$
  and $X$ does not contain any nonzero point of $\Gamma$.

\item[(2)]
  Suppose $X$ is compact.
  Consider $X_\nu = (1+\frac{1}{m})X$ for each $\nu \in \mathbb{Z}_{> 0}$.
  Thus $X_\nu$ is again a centrally symmetric convex set in $V$
  and
  \begin{align*}
    \mathrm{vol}(X_\nu)
    &= \left( 1+\frac{1}{\nu} \right) \mathrm{vol}(X) \\
    &\geq \left( 1+\frac{1}{\nu} \right) 2^n \mathrm{vol}(\Gamma) \\
    &> 2^n \mathrm{vol}(\Gamma).
  \end{align*}
  Minkowski's lattice point theorem shows that
  there is one nonzero lattice point $\gamma_\nu \in \Gamma$ for $\nu = 1, 2, 3 \ldots$.

\item[(3)]
  By the compactness of $X_1$,
  there is a subsequence of $\{ \gamma_\nu \}$ converging to $\gamma \in X_1$.
  Since $\Gamma$ is discrete (Proposition I.4.2),
  there are infinitely many $\nu$ such that $\gamma = \gamma_\nu \in X_\nu$.
  (In particular, $\gamma \neq 0$.)
  Hence $\gamma \in X$ by the compactness of $X$.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.5.3. (Minkowski bound)}
\emph{Show that in every ideal $\mathfrak{a} \neq 0$ of $\mathcal{O}_K$
there exists an $a \neq 0$ such that
\[
  \abs{ N_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(a) } \leq M (\mathcal{O}_K : \mathfrak{a}),
\]
where $M = \frac{n!}{n^n} \left( \frac{4}{\pi} \right)^{s} \sqrt{|d_K|}$
(the so-called \textbf{Minkowski bound}.)} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let
  \[
    X_t = \left\{ (z_\tau) \in K_{\mathbb{R}} : \sum_{\tau}|z_\tau| \leq t \right\}
  \]
  be a convex, centrally symmetric set for any $t > 0$.
  Note that $\mathrm{vol}(X_t) = 2^r \pi^s \frac{t^n}{n!}$ (same as Exercise I.5.2).

\item[(2)]
  In particular, we take $t > 0$ so that
  \[
    \mathrm{vol}(X_t)
    = 2^r \pi^s \frac{t^n}{n!}
    = 2^n \mathrm{vol}(\Gamma).
  \]
  Thus the hypothesis of Minkowski's lattice point theorem in Exercise I.4.2
  is satisfied.
  So there does indeed exist a lattice point $ja \in X_t$, $a \neq 0$, $a \in \mathfrak{a}$;
  in other words, $\sum_\tau |\tau a| \leq t$.

\item[(3)]
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    \abs{ N_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(a) }
    &= \prod_{\tau} |\tau a| \\
    &\leq \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{\tau}|\tau a| \right)^n
      &(\text{AM-GM inequality}) \\
    &\leq \frac{t^n}{n^n}
      &(ja \in X_t) \\
    &= \frac{1}{n^n} \frac{n!}{2^r \pi^s} 2^n \mathrm{vol}(\Gamma)
      &(\text{Definition of $t^n$}) \\
    &= \frac{1}{n^n} \frac{n!}{2^r \pi^s} 2^n \sqrt{|d_K|} (\mathcal{O}_K : \mathfrak{a})
      &(\text{Proposition I.5.2}) \\
    &= \underbrace{\frac{n!}{n^n} \left( \frac{4}{\pi} \right)^{s} \sqrt{|d_K|}}_{:= M}
      (\mathcal{O}_K : \mathfrak{a}).
      &(n = r + 2s)
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise VII.1.4.}
\emph{For the power sum
\[
  s_k(n) = 1^k + 2^k + 3^k + \cdots + n^k
\]
one has}
\[
  s_k(n) = \frac{1}{k+1} (B_{k+1}(n) - B_{k+1}(0)).
\] \\



\emph{Proof.}
  By Exercise VII.1.3,
  \[
    x^k = \frac{1}{k+1} (B_{k+1}(x) - B_{k+1}(x-1)).
  \]
  Hence the telescoping sum is
  \begin{align*}
     s_k(n)
     &= \sum_{x=1}^{n} x^k \\
     &= \sum_{x=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k+1} (B_{k+1}(x) - B_{k+1}(x-1)) \\
     &= \frac{1}{k+1} (B_{k+1}(n) - B_{k+1}(0)).
  \end{align*}
$\Box$ \\\\
