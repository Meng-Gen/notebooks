\subsubsection*{Exercise I.1.1.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.1.1.}
\emph{$\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unit if and only if $N(\alpha) = 1$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{$(\Longrightarrow)$}
  Since $\alpha$ is a unit, there is $\beta \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that
  $\alpha \beta = 1$.
  So $N(\alpha \beta) = N(1)$, or $N(\alpha) N(\beta) = 1$.
  Since the image of $N$ is nonnegative integers, $N(\alpha) = 1$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{$(\Longleftarrow)$}
  $N(\alpha) = \alpha \overline{\alpha}$,
  or $1 = \alpha \overline{\alpha}$ since $N(\alpha) = 1$.
  That is, $\overline{\alpha} \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ is
  the inverse of $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$.
  (Or we solve the equation $N(\alpha) = a^2 + b^2 = 1$,
  and show that all four solutions ($\pm 1$ and $\pm i$) are units.)

\item[(3)]
  Conclusion: a unit $\alpha = a+bi$ of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$
  is satisfying the equation $N(\alpha) = a^2 + b^2 = 1$ by (1)(2).
  That is, the only unit of $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ are $\pm 1$ and $\pm i$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.1.2.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.1.2.}
\emph{Show that, in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, the relation $\alpha\beta = \varepsilon\gamma^n$,
for $\alpha,\beta$ relatively prime numbers and $\varepsilon$ a unit,
implies $\alpha = \varepsilon' \xi^n$ and $\beta = \varepsilon'' \eta^n$,
with $\varepsilon', \varepsilon''$ units.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  It suffices to prove that the conclusion holds for any unique factorization domain $R$
  (since $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unique factorization domain).

\item[(2)]
  Write the unique factorizations of $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ as
  \[
    \alpha = \varepsilon_1 p_1^{a_1} \cdots p_r^{a_r},
    \qquad
    \beta = \varepsilon_2 p_1^{b_1} \cdots p_r^{b_r},
    \qquad
    \gamma = \varepsilon_3 p_1^{c_1} \cdots p_r^{c_r},
  \]
  where $p_i$ are prime elements in $R$, $p_i \neq p_j$ if $i \neq j$ (up to unit),
  and $\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_2, \varepsilon_3$ are units.

\item[(3)]
  By the relation $\alpha\beta = \varepsilon\gamma^n$, we have
  \[
    \varepsilon_1 \varepsilon_2 p_1^{a_1+b_1} \cdots p_r^{a_r+b_r}
    = \varepsilon \varepsilon_3^n p_1^{n c_1} \cdots p_r^{n c_r} \in R.
  \]
  Since $R$ is a unique factorization domain,
  $a_i + b_i = n c_i$ for each $1 \leq i \leq r$.
  Since $\alpha,\beta$ are relatively prime, $a_i = 0$ or $b_i = 0$ for each $i$.
  Hence
  \[
    (a_i,b_i) = (0,nc_i) \text{ or } (nc_i,0).
  \]
  In any case, $\alpha = \varepsilon_1 \xi^n$ and $\beta = \varepsilon_2 \eta^n$
  for some $\xi, \eta \in R$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.1.3. (Pythagorean triples)}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.1.3. (Pythagorean triples)}
\emph{Show that the integer solutions of the equation
\[
  x^2+y^2 = z^2
\]
such that $x, y, z > 0$ and $(x,y,z) = 1$ (``pythagorean triples'') are all given,
up to possible permutation of $x$ and $y$, by the formula
\[
  x = u^2-v^2,
  \qquad
  y = 2uv,
  \qquad
  z = u^2+v^2
\]
where $u, v \in \mathbb{Z}$, $u > v > 0$, $(u,v) = 1$, $u, v$ not both odd.
(Hint: Use Exercise I.1.2 to show that necessarily $x+iy = \varepsilon\alpha^2$
with a unit $\varepsilon$ and with $\alpha = u+iv \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$.)} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Since $x^2+y^2=z^2$ and $(x,y,z) = 1$,
  we might assume that $(x,y) = 1$, $x$ is odd and $y$ is even.
  Thus $z$ is odd.
  Write $z^2 = x^2+y^2 = (x+iy)(x-iy) \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $x+iy$ and $x-iy$ are relatively prime over $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    Suppose $\delta \mid x \pm iy$ for some $\delta \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$.
    Consider the norm of $\delta$.
    \[
      N(\delta) \mid N(x \pm iy) = x^2 + y^2 = z^2
    \]
    implies that $N(\delta)$ is odd.
  
  \item[(b)]
    $\delta \mid 2x = (x+iy)+(x-iy)$ and $\delta \mid 2iy = (x+iy)-(x-iy)$
    imply that $N(\delta) \mid 4x^2$ and $N(\delta) \mid 4y^2$.
    Since $(x,y) = 1$, $N(\delta) \mid 4$ or $N(\delta) = 1, 2, 4$.

  \item[(c)]
    Hence $N(\delta) = 1$ by (1)(2).
    Exercise I.1.1 shows that $\delta$ is a unit.
    Therefore the conclusion holds.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(3)]
  Exercise I.1.2 shows that $x+iy = \varepsilon (u+iv)^2$
  for some $u, v \in \mathbb{Z}$ and a unit $\varepsilon$.
  As $x > 0$ is odd and $y > 0$ is even, we might take $\varepsilon = 1$ and $u > v$.
  Hence
  \[
    x = u^2-v^2,
    \qquad
    y = 2uv,
    \qquad
    z = u^2+v^2
  \]
  where $u, v \in \mathbb{Z}$, $u > v > 0$, $(u,v) = 1$.
  Note that $u, v$ cannot be both odd since $x = u^2-v^2$ is not even.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.1.4.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.1.4.}
\emph{Show that the ring $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ cannot be ordered.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
  Similar to the fact that $i$ cannot be ordered in $\mathbb{C}$.
  Thus $i$ cannot be ordered in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ either.
$\Box$ \\\\



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\subsubsection*{Exercise I.1.5.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.1.5.}
\emph{Show that the only units of the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-d}] = \mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z}\sqrt{-d}$,
for any rational integer $d > 1$, are $\pm 1$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Define the norm $N$ on $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-d}]$ by
  \[
    N(x+y\sqrt{-d}) = (x+y\sqrt{-d})(x-y\sqrt{-d}) = x^2 + y^2 d,
  \]
  i.e., by $N(z) = |z|^2$.
  It is multiplicative.

\item[(2)]
  Similar to Exercise I.1.1,
  \begin{align*}
    \text{$x+y\sqrt{-d} \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-d}]$ is a unit}
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    N(x+y\sqrt{-d}) = x^2 + y^2 d = 1 \\
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    x^2 = 1 \text{ and } y = 0 \\
    &\Longleftrightarrow
    x = \pm 1 \text{ and } y = 0.
  \end{align*}
  Hence the only units of the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-d}]$ are $\pm 1$ ($d > 1$).
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\subsubsection*{Exercise I.1.6.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.1.6.}
\emph{Show that the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}] = \mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z}\sqrt{d}$,
for any squarefree rational integer $d > 1$, has infinitely many units.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
The proof is quoted from Proposition 17.5.2 in the book:
Ireland and Rosen, \emph{A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory, 2nd Ed.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Define the norm of $z = x + \sqrt{d} y \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ by
  $N(z) = z \overline{z}$ or
  \[
    N(x + \sqrt{d} y)
    = \underbrace{(x + \sqrt{d} y)}_{= z} \underbrace{(x - \sqrt{d} y)}_{:= \overline{z}}
    = x^2 - dy^2.
  \]
  Note that a norm is multiplicative.
  Similar to Exercise I.1.1,
  $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ is a unit if and only if $N(\alpha) = \pm 1$.

\item[(2)]
  To show $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ has infinitely many units, it suffices to show
  the equation $x^2 - dy^2 = 1$ has infinitely many $(x,y)$ solutions.

\item[(3)]
  \emph{If $\xi$ is irrational then there are infinitely many rational numbers
  $\frac{x}{y}$, $(x,y) = 1$ such that $\abs{\frac{x}{y}-\xi} < \frac{1}{y^2}$.}
  It is followed by the pigeonhole principle.

\item[(4)]
  \emph{If $d$ is a positive squarefree integer then there is a constant $M := 2\sqrt{d}+1$
  such that $\abs{x^2 - dy^2} < M$ has infinitely many solutions over $\mathbb{Z}$.}
  Write $x^2 - dy^2 = (x + \sqrt{d} y)(x - \sqrt{d} y)$.
  By part (3), there exist infinitely many pairs of relatively prime integers $(x,y)$, $y > 0$
  satisfying $\abs{x - \sqrt{d} y} < \frac{1}{y}$.
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    \abs{x^2 - dy^2}
    =& \: \abs{x + \sqrt{d} y}\abs{x - \sqrt{d} y} \\
    \leq & \: \left(\abs{x - \sqrt{d} y} + 2 \sqrt{d}y \right) \abs{x - \sqrt{d} y} \\
    \leq & \: 2 \sqrt{d} + 1.
  \end{align*}

\item[(5)]
  By part (4), there is an integer $m$ such that $x^2 - dy^2 = m$
  for infinitely many solutions over $\mathbb{Z}$.
  Here $m \neq 0$.
  We might assume $x, y > 0$ and $x$ components of solutions are distinct.

\item[(6)]
  The pigeonhole principle shows that there are two distinct solutions $(x_1,y_1)$, $(x_2,y_2)$
  with $x_1 \neq x_2$ such that
  \[
    x_1 \equiv x_2 \pmod{|m|},
    \qquad 
    y_1 \equiv y_2 \pmod{|m|}.
  \]
  Let $\alpha = x_1 - \sqrt{d} y_1$, $\beta = x_2 + \sqrt{d} y_2$ and $\gamma = \alpha\beta$.
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    \gamma
    &= (x_1 - \sqrt{d} y_1)(x_2 + \sqrt{d} y_2) \\
    &= \underbrace{(x_1 x_2 - d y_1 y_2)}_{\equiv 0 \pmod{|m|}}
        + \sqrt{d}\underbrace{(x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1)}_{\equiv 0 \pmod{|m|}} \\
    &:= m(u + \sqrt{d} v)
  \end{align*}
  for some $u + \sqrt{d} v \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$.
  Taking norms of $\gamma = \alpha\beta$ gives $N(\gamma) = N(\alpha)N(\beta)$ or
  \[
    m^2 (u + \sqrt{d} v) = m^2.
  \]
  Hence $u + \sqrt{d} v = 1$.
  By construction of $x_1, x_2$, $v \neq 0$.
  Therefore the equation $x^2 - dy^2 = 1$ has one solution with $x, y > 0$.

\item[(7)]
  By part (6), we might take a unit $\varepsilon = x + \sqrt{d}y \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$
  with $x, y > 0$.
  Note that $\varepsilon \geq 1 + \sqrt{d} > 1$ (over the ordered field $\mathbb{R}$).
  Hence there are infinitely many units
  \[
    \varepsilon, \varepsilon^2, \varepsilon^3, \ldots
  \]
  in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Note.}
  \emph{Furthermore, show that there is a unit $\varepsilon$ such that every unit has the form
  $\pm \varepsilon^n$, $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  By the well-ordering principle,
  there is a unit $\varepsilon = x_1 + \sqrt{d}y_1 \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ such that
  $x_1, y_1 > 0$ and $(x_1,y_1)$ is the smallest solution of $x^2 - dy^2 = \pm 1$ with $x, y > 0$.

\item[(2)]
  Now given any unit $\varepsilon' = x + \sqrt{d}y$, $x, y > 0$,
  it suffices to show that there is a positive integer $n$ such that $\varepsilon' = \varepsilon^n$.

\item[(3)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  If not, there were a positive integer $n$ such that $\varepsilon^n < \varepsilon' < \varepsilon^{n+1}$.
  Hence $1 < \varepsilon^{-n} \varepsilon' < \varepsilon$.
  Say $\varepsilon^{-n} \varepsilon' := x' + \sqrt{d}y'$.
  As $\varepsilon^{-n} \varepsilon' > 1 > 0$, the inverse is satisfying $x' - \sqrt{d}y' > 0$.
  Hence $x' > 0$.

\item[(4)]
  As the inverse is satisfying $x' - \sqrt{d}y' < 1$, $y' \geq 0$.
  Note that $y' \neq 0$ (since $\varepsilon > 1$).
  Hence the existence of $\varepsilon^{-n} \varepsilon'$ contradicts the minimality of $\varepsilon$.

\item[(5)]
  Now suppose a unit $\varepsilon' = x + \sqrt{d}y$ is of the form $x > 0$, $y < 0$.
  Then $\varepsilon'^{-1} = x - \sqrt{d}y = \varepsilon^n$ for some positive integer $n$ by (2)(3)(4).
  Hence $\varepsilon' = \varepsilon^{-n}$ for some positive integer $n$.
  Other two cases of $\varepsilon' = x + \sqrt{d}y$ are similar.
  Therefore, every unit has the form $\pm \varepsilon^n$, $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.1.7.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.1.7.}
\emph{Show that the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}] = \mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z}\sqrt{2}$ is euclidean.
Show furthermore that its units are given by $\pm(1+\sqrt{2})^n$, $n \in \mathbb{Z}$,
and determine its prime elements.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ is euclidean with respect to the function
  $N: \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}] \to \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$, $\alpha \mapsto \alpha \overline{\alpha}$.}
  For
  \[
    \alpha, \beta \neq 0 \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}],
  \]
  one has to find
  \[
    \gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]
  \]
  such that
  \[
    \alpha = \gamma\beta + \rho,
    \qquad
    N(\rho) < N(\beta).
  \]

\item[(2)]
  Extend the norm function $N$ to $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}]$.
  Write
  \[
    \frac{\alpha}{\beta} = x + \sqrt{2}y \in \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}].
  \]
  Take $\gamma = u + \sqrt{2}v \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$
  such that $u, v$ are satisfying $\abs{u - x} \leq \frac{1}{2}$, $\abs{v - y} \leq \frac{1}{2}$.
  Now take $\rho = \alpha - \gamma\beta$.

\item[(3)]
  Hence,
  \[
    N\left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta} - \gamma\right)
    = (u-x)^2 + 2 (v-y)^2
    \leq \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2} + 2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}
    < 1
  \]
  and thus
  \[
    N(\rho)
    = N(\alpha - \gamma\beta)
    = N(\beta) N\left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta} - \gamma\right)
    < N(\beta).
  \]

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that its units are given by $\pm(1+\sqrt{2})^n$, $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.}
  $\varepsilon = 1 + \sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ is a unit such that
  $(1,1)$ is the smallest solution of $x^2 - 2y^2 = \pm 1$ with $x, y > 0$.
  By the note in Exercise I.1.6,
  all units are given by $\pm(1+\sqrt{2})^n$, $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

\item[(5)]
  \emph{For all prime numbers $p \neq 2$, one has
  $p = a^2 - 2b^2$ ($a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$) if and only if $p \equiv 1, 7 \pmod 8$.}
  Similar to the proof of Proposition I.1.1,
  it suffices to show that a prime number $p \equiv 1, 7 \pmod 8$ of $\mathbb{Z}$
  does not remain a prime element in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$.
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  Note that the congruence
  \[
    2 \equiv x^2 \pmod p
  \]
  admits a solution (by the law of quadratic reciprocity).
  Thus we have $p \mid x^2 - 2 = (x + \sqrt{2})(x - \sqrt{2})$.
  Hence $\frac{x}{p} \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{p} \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$, which is absurd.

\item[(6)]
  \emph{The prime element $\pi$ of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$, up to associated elements,
  are given as follows.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(i)]
    $\pi = \sqrt{2}$,

  \item[(ii)]
    \emph{$\pi = a + \sqrt{2}b$ with $a^2 - 2b^2 = p$, $p \equiv 1, 7 \pmod 8$},

  \item[(iii)]
    $\pi = p$, $p \equiv 3, 5 \pmod 8$.
  \end{enumerate}
  \emph{Here, $p$ denotes a prime number of $\mathbb{Z}$.}
  The proof is exactly the same as Theorem I.1.4.

$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.2.1.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.2.1.}
\emph{Is $\frac{3+2\sqrt{6}}{1-\sqrt{6}}$ an algebraic integer?} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $\alpha := \frac{3+2\sqrt{6}}{1-\sqrt{6}} = -3-\sqrt{6}$.
  Since the set of all algebraic integers is a ring,
  $\alpha$ is an algebraic integer.

\item[(2)]
  Or show that $\alpha$ satisfies a monic equation $x^2 + 6x + 3 = 0 \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\subsubsection*{Exercise I.2.2.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Exercise I.2.2.}
\emph{Show that, if the integral domain $A$ is integrally closed,
then so is the polynomial ring $A[t]$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Suppose $A$ is integrally closed in $B$.
  Show that $A[t]$ is integrally closed in $B[t]$.}
  Suppose $f \in B[t]$ is integral over $A[t]$.
  Write
  \[
    f^n + g_1 f^{n-1} + \cdots + g_{n-1} f + g_n = 0 
  \]
  where $n > 0$ and $g_i \in A[t]$.
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    &\:
    f^n + g_1 f^{n-1} + \cdots + g_{n-1} f = -g_n \in A[t] \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    f(\underbrace{f^{n-1} + g_1 f^{n-1} + \cdots + g_{n-1}}_{:= g}) \in A[t].
  \end{align*}
  It is possible to show that $fg \in A[t]$ implies that $f \in A[t]$ and $g \in A[t]$
  by using the fact that $A$ is integrally closed in $B$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Suppose $f, g$ are monic polynomials in $B[t]$.
  Show that $fg \in A[t]$ implies that $f \in A[t]$ and $g \in A[t]$.}
  Write
  \[
    f = \prod (t - \xi_i),
    \qquad
    g = \prod (t - \eta_j)
  \]
  in some splitting field $F$ of $f$ and $g$ containing the quotient field of $B$.
  Note that each $\xi_i$ and each $\eta_j$ is a root of a monic equation $fg$ in $A[t]$.
  Since $A$ is integrally closed in $B$, $\xi_i, \eta_j \in A$.
  Hence $f, g \in A[t]$.

\item[(3)]
  To apply part (2), we need to remedy leading coefficients of $f$ and $g$.
  Take an integer $m > \max\{\deg(f), \deg(g_1), \ldots, \deg(g_n) \}$.
  Let $f_0 = t^m + f$ be a monic polynomial in $B[t]$.
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    &\:
    (f_0 - t^m)^n + g_1 (f_0 - t^m)^{n-1} + \cdots + g_n = 0 \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    f_0^n + h_1 f_0^{n-1} + \cdots + h_n = 0
  \end{align*}
  where
  \[
    h_n = t^{mn} + (-1)^{n-1} g_1 t^{m(n-1)} + \cdots + g_n \in A[t]
  \]
  is also monic.
  So
  \begin{align*}
    &\:
    f_0^n + h_1 f_0^{n-1} + \cdots + h_{n-1} f = -h_n \text{ is monic in } A[t] \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    f_0(\underbrace{f_0^{n-1} + h_1 f^{n-1} + \cdots + h_{n-1}}_{:= h_0}) \in A[t] \text{ where } \\
    &\: \text{$f_0$ and $h_0$ both are monic in } B[t].
  \end{align*}
  Now we can apply part (2) safely.

\item[(4)]
  In part (1), we let $B$ be the quotient field of $A$
  and thus the quotient field of $A[t]$ is $B(t)$.
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    &\:
    \text{$f \in B(t)$ integral over $A[t]$} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \text{$f \in B(t)$ integral over $B[t]$}
      &(A[t] \subseteq B[t]) \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    f \in B[t]
      &(\text{$B[t]$ is a UFD}) \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \text{$f \in B[t]$ integral over $A[t]$} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    f \in A[t].

\emph{In the polynomial ring $A = \mathbb{Q}[x,y]$,
consider the principal ideal $\mathfrak{p} = (x^2-y^3)$.
Show that $\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal,
but $A/\mathfrak{p}$ is not integrally closed.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  It is easy to show that $x^2-y^3$ is irreducible in $A$.
  Hence $\mathfrak{p} = (x^2-y^3)$ is prime since $A$ is a UFD.

  Note that $\mathbb{Q}[t]$ is a UFD, thus is already integrally closed.
  So the integral closure will be $\mathbb{Q}[t] \supsetneq \mathbb{Q}[t^3,t^2]$.
  It suggests that $A/\mathfrak{p}$ might not be integrally closed.

\item[(3)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  If not, then the element $\frac{x}{y}$ satisfies a monic equation
  $t^2 - y = 0 \in (A/\mathfrak{p})[t]$.

\emph{Let $D$ be a squarefree rational integer $\neq 0, 1$ and
$d$ the discriminant of the quadratic number field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$.
Show that
\begin{equation*}
  d = \begin{cases}
    D  & \text{if $D \equiv 1 \pmod 4$,}\\
    4D & \text{if $D \equiv 2, 3 \pmod 4$.}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
and that an integral basis of $K$ is given by $\{1, \sqrt{D}\}$ in the second case,
by $\left\{ 1, \frac{1+\sqrt{D}}{2} \right\}$ in the first case,
and by $\left\{ 1, \frac{d+\sqrt{d}}{2} \right\}$ in both case.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  The Galois group of $K|\mathbb{Q}$ has two elements, the identity
  and an automorphism sending $\sqrt{D}$ to $-\sqrt{D}$.

\item[(2)]
  Note that $\alpha \in \mathcal{O}_K$
  iff $\mathrm{Tr}_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha), N_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) \in \mathbb{Z}$
  (by noting that the equation
  $x^2 - \mathrm{Tr}_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) x + N_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) = 0$ has
  a root $x = \alpha$).
  So given $\alpha = x + y \sqrt{D} \in \mathcal{O}_K$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    \mathrm{Tr}_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) &= 2x \in \mathbb{Z}, \\
    N_{K|\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha) &= x^2 - D y^2 \in \mathbb{Z}.
  \end{align*}

\item[(3)]
  So $4(x^2 - D y^2) = (2x)^2 - D(2y)^2 \in \mathbb{Z}$.
  So $D(2y)^2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ since $2x \in \mathbb{Z}$.
  So $2y \in \mathbb{Z}$ since $D$ is squarefree $\neq 0, 1$.
  Let $r = 2x, s = 2y$.
  Then $r^2 - Ds^2 \equiv 0 \pmod 4$.
  Note that a square $\equiv 0, 1 \pmod 4$.

\item[(4)]
  If $D \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, then
  \begin{align*}
    &\:r^2 - Ds^2 \equiv r^2 - s^2 \pmod 4 \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \text{$r$ and $s$ has the same parity} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \mathcal{O}_K = \left\{ \frac{r+s\sqrt{D}}{2} : r \equiv s \pmod 2 \right\} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \mathcal{O}_K = \left\{ \frac{r-s}{2} + s \cdot \frac{1+\sqrt{D}}{2}
      : r \equiv s \pmod 2 \right\} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z} \frac{1+\sqrt{D}}{2}.
  \end{align*}
  So $\left\{ 1, \frac{1+\sqrt{D}}{2} \right\}$ is an integral basis of $K$.
  Hence
  \[
    d
    =
    \begin{vmatrix}
      1 & \frac{1+\sqrt{D}}{2} \\
      1 & \frac{1-\sqrt{D}}{2}
    \end{vmatrix}^2
    = D.
  \]

\item[(5)]
  If $D \equiv 2, 3 \pmod 4$, then
  \begin{align*}
    &\:r^2 - Ds^2 \equiv r^2+2s^2 \text{ or } r^2+s^2 \pmod 4 \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \text{both $r$ and $s$ are even} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \text{both $x$ and $y$ are rational integers} \\
    \Longrightarrow &\:
    \mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z} + \mathbb{Z}\sqrt{D}.
  \end{align*}
  So $\{ 1, \sqrt{D} \}$ is an integral basis of $K$.
  Hence
  \[
    d
    =
    \begin{vmatrix}
      1 & \sqrt{D} \\
      1 & -\sqrt{D}
    \end{vmatrix}^2
    = 4D.
  \]

\item[(6)]
  By (4)(5),
  $\left\{ 1, \frac{d+\sqrt{d}}{2} \right\}$ is an integral basis of $K$
  for any case.

  Let $S_n$ be the symmetric group of degree $n$, and

$\pi_i \in \mathfrak{p}_{i} \smallsetminus \mathfrak{p}_{i}^2$
and apply the Chinese remainder theorem for the cosets
$\pi_i^{\nu_i} \pmod{\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{\nu_i+1}}$.)} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  The hint gives all.

\item[(2)]
  The existence of $\pi_i$ is guaranteed by Theorem I.3.3 (the unique prime factorization).
  The Chinese remainder theorem shows that there is one element $\pi \in \mathcal{O}$
  such that $\pi = \pi_i^{\nu_i} \pmod{\mathfrak{p}_{i}^{\nu_i+1}}$ for each $i$.

are given by $\mathfrak{p}/\mathfrak{p}^n, \ldots, \mathfrak{p}^{n-1}/\mathfrak{p}^n$.
Choose $\pi \in \mathfrak{p} \smallsetminus \mathfrak{p}^2$
and show that $\mathfrak{p}^{\nu} = \mathcal{O}\pi^{\nu} + \mathfrak{p}^n$.)} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  By the Chinese remainder theorem,
  it suffices to show the case $\mathfrak{a} = \mathfrak{p}^n$ where $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime.

\item[(2)]
  There is a natural correspondence between
  \[
    \{ \text{ideals of $\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{p}^n$} \}
    \longleftrightarrow
    \{ \text{ideals of $\mathcal{O}$ containing $\mathfrak{p}^n$} \}.

\item[(3)]
  Similar to Exercise I.3.4,

  and thus $\mathfrak{p}^{\nu} = \mathcal{O}\pi^{\nu} + \mathfrak{p}^n$
  ($\nu = 1, \ldots, n-1$)

  $\mathfrak{p}^{\nu}/\mathfrak{p}^n = (\pi^{\nu} + \mathfrak{p}^n)$ is principal.

  Given an ideal $\mathfrak{a} \neq 0$  of a Dedekind domain $\mathcal{O}$.

  So $\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{a}$ is a principal ideal domain (Exercise I.3.5).

\item[(2)]
  Take any $\alpha \in \mathfrak{a} \smallsetminus \{0\}$.
  So
  $(\alpha)/\mathfrak{a} = (\beta \pmod{\mathfrak{a}})$ is a principal ideal

\item[(2)]

  Let $V_0$ be the linear subspace of $V$ which is spanned by the set $\Gamma$.

If $X$ is compact, however,
then the statement $\mathrm{vol}(X) > 2^n \mathrm{vol}(\Gamma)$ does remain true
in the case of equality.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Let $V = \mathbb{R}^n$, $\Gamma = \mathbb{Z}^n$ be a complete lattice in $V$, and
  $X = (-1,1)^n \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a centrally symmetric convex set in $V$.
  Hence $\mathrm{vol}(X) = 2^n \mathrm{vol}(\Gamma)$
  and $X$ does not contain any nonzero point of $\Gamma$.

\item[(2)]
  Suppose $X$ is compact.
  Consider $X_\nu = (1+\frac{1}{m})X$ for each $\nu \in \mathbb{Z}_{> 0}$.
  Thus $X_\nu$ is again a centrally symmetric convex set in $V$
  and
  \begin{align*}
    \mathrm{vol}(X_\nu)
    &= \left( 1+\frac{1}{\nu} \right) \mathrm{vol}(X) \\

  \end{align*}
  Minkowski's lattice point theorem shows that
  there is one nonzero lattice point $\gamma_\nu \in \Gamma$ for $\nu = 1, 2, 3 \ldots$.

\item[(3)]
  By the compactness of $X_1$,
  there is a subsequence of $\{ \gamma_\nu \}$ converging to $\gamma \in X_1$.
  Since $\Gamma$ is discrete (Proposition I.4.2),
  there are infinitely many $\nu$ such that $\gamma = \gamma_\nu \in X_\nu$.

  Note that $\mathrm{vol}(X_t) = 2^r \pi^s \frac{t^n}{n!}$ (same as Exercise I.5.2).

  In particular, we take $t > 0$ so that

  Before Harold joins his men, they are in $13$ squares,

  Once Harold joins them, they all together rearrange themselves to form a single square.

  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  If $M' \neq 0$,

  Since $\mathfrak{m}$ is the maximal ideal of a local ring, $1-m_n$ is a unit.

  or $a_0 \neq 0$.

\item[(2)]
  ($\Longleftarrow$)
  Our goal is to find
  \[
    b = b_0 + b_1 p + b_2 p^2 + \cdots \in \mathbb{Z}_p
  \]
  such that the Cauchy product
  \[
    ab = c_0 + c_1 p + c_2 p^2 + \cdots
  \]
  is equal to $1 \in \mathbb{Z}_p$.
  Here $c_n = \sum_{\nu = 0}^{n} a_{\nu} b_{n-\nu}$.
  By the assumption we have that $c_0 = 1$ and $c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = 0$.
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    b_0 &= a_0^{-1} \\
    b_1 &= -a_0^{-1} a_1 b_0 \\
    & \cdots \\
    b_n &= a_0^{-1} \sum_{\nu = 1}^{n} a_\nu b_{n-\nu} \\
    & \cdots
  \end{align*}
  by induction.

  Let $A$ be a commutative ring with $1$ and $A[[x]]$ be
  the ring of formal power series $f = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n$
  with coefficients in $A$.
  Then $f$ is a unit in $A[[x]]$ if and only if $a_0$ is a unit in $A$.

\emph{(Exercise 1.5 (i) in the textbook: Atiyah \& Macdonald, Introduction to Commutative Algebra.)
Let $A$ be a ring and let $A[[x]]$ be the ring of formal power series
$f = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n$ with coefficients in $A$.
Show that $f$ is a unit in $A[[x]]$ if and only if $a_0$ is a unit in $A$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  ($\Longrightarrow$)
  If $g = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n x^n$ is an inverse of $f$,
  then $fg = 1$ implies that $a_0 b_0 = 1$ so that $a_0$ is a unit in $A$.

\item[(2)]
  ($\Longleftarrow$)
  Our goal is to find $g = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n x^n$
  such that the Cauchy product
  $fg = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n x^n$
  is equal to $1 \in A[x]$.
  Here $c_n = \sum_{r = 0}^{n} a_{r} b_{n-r}$.
  By the assumption we have that $c_0 = 1$ and $c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = 0$.
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    b_0 &= a_0^{-1} \\
    b_1 &= -a_0^{-1} a_1 b_0 \\
    & \cdots \\
    b_n &= a_0^{-1} \sum_{r = 1}^{n} a_r b_{n-r} \\
    & \cdots
  \end{align*}
  by induction.

\emph{For the power sum
\[

\]
one has}
\[
  s_k(n) = \frac{1}{k+1} (B_{k+1}(n) - B_{k+1}(0)).
\] \\



\emph{Proof.}
  By Exercise VII.1.3,
  \[
    x^k = \frac{1}{k+1} (B_{k+1}(x) - B_{k+1}(x-1)).
  \]
  Hence the telescoping sum is
  \begin{align*}
     s_k(n)
     &= \sum_{x=1}^{n} x^k \\
     &= \sum_{x=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k+1} (B_{k+1}(x) - B_{k+1}(x-1)) \\
     &= \frac{1}{k+1} (B_{k+1}(n) - B_{k+1}(0)).
