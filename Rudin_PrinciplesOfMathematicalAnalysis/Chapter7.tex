\textbf{Exercise 7.1.}
\emph{Prove that every uniformly convergent sequence of bounded functions
is uniformly bounded.} \\

\emph{Proof (Cauchy criterion).}
Let $\{f_n\}$ be a uniformly convergent sequence of bounded functions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
Since $f_n$ is bounded, there exists $M_n$ such that $|f_n(x)| \leq M_n$.

\item[(2)]
Since $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly, given $1 > 0$ there exists an integer $N$
such that
\[
  |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| \leq 1 \text{ whenever } n, m \geq N
\]
(Theorem 7.8 (Cauchy criterion for uniformly convergence)).
Especially,
\[
  |f_n(x)| \leq |f_n(x) - f_N(x)| + |f_N(x)| \leq 1 + M_N \text{ whenever } n \geq N.
\]

\item[(3)]
Thus, $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly bounded by $M = \max\{ M_1, \ldots, M_{N-1}, M_{N}+1 \}$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\textbf{Exercise 7.2.}
\emph{If $\{f_n\}$ and $\{g_n\}$ converge uniformly on a set $E$,
prove that $\{f_n + g_n\}$ converge uniformly on $E$.
If, in addition, $\{f_n\}$ and $\{g_n\}$ are sequences of bounded functions,
prove that $\{f_n g_n\}$ converges uniformly on $E$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
Let $f_n \to f$ uniformly and $g_n \to g$ uniformly.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\{f_n + g_n\}$ converges uniformly.}
    Given $\varepsilon > 0$.
    Since $f_n \to f$ uniformly and $g_n \to g$ uniformly,
    there exist two integers $N_1$ and $N_2$ such that
    \begin{align*}
      |f_n(x) - f(x)| \leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
      &\text{ whenever }
      n \geq N_1, x \in E \\
      |g_n(x) - g(x)| \leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
      &\text{ whenever }
      n \geq N_2, x \in E.
    \end{align*}
    Take $N = \max\{N_1,N_2\}$, we have
    \begin{align*}
      &|(f_n(x)+ g_n(x)) - (f(x) + g(x))| \\
      =& |(f_n(x) - f(x)) + (g_n(x) - g(x))| \\
      \leq& |f_n(x) - f(x)| + |g_n(x) - g(x)| \\
      \leq& \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
      =& \varepsilon
    \end{align*}
    whenever $n \geq N$, $x \in E$.
    Hence $f_n + g_n \to f+g$ uniformly on $E$.

  \item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $\{f_n g_n\}$ converges uniformly
  if, in addition, $\{f_n\}$ and $\{g_n\}$ are sequences of bounded functions.}
  Given $\varepsilon > 0$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)]
    By Exercise 7.1, both $\{f_n\}$ and $\{g_n\}$ are uniformly bounded.
    So there exist $M_1$ and $M_2$
    such that
    \[
      |f_n(x)| \leq M_1 \text{ and } |g_n(x)| \leq M_2
    \]
    for all $n$ and $x \in E$.
    Also, $|f(x)| \leq M_1 + 1$ and $|g(x)| \leq M_2 + 1$.

    \item[(b)]
    Since $f_n \to f$ uniformly and $g_n \to g$ uniformly,
    there exist two integers $N_1$ and $N_2$ such that
    \begin{align*}
      |f_n(x) - f(x)| \leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2(M_2 + 1)}
      &\text{ whenever }
      n \geq N_1, x \in E \\
      |g_n(x) - g(x)| \leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2(M_1 + 1)}
      &\text{ whenever }
      n \geq N_2, x \in E.
    \end{align*}
    (Note that each denominator of $\frac{\varepsilon}{2(M_j + 1)}$ $(j=1,2)$
    is well-defined and positive!)
    Take $N = \max\{N_1,N_2\}$, we have
    \begin{align*}
      &|f_n(x)g_n(x) - f(x)g(x)| \\
      =& |[f_n(x) - f(x)]g_n(x) + f(x)[g_n(x) - g(x)]| \\
      \leq& |f_n(x) - f(x)||g_n(x)| + |f(x)||g_n(x) - g(x)| \\
      \leq& \frac{\varepsilon}{2(M_2 + 1)} \cdot M_2
        + (M_1 + 1) \cdot \frac{\varepsilon}{2(M_1 + 1)} \\
      \leq& \varepsilon
    \end{align*}
    whenever $n \geq N$, $x \in E$.
    Hence $f_n g_n \to fg$ uniformly on $E$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Proof (Cauchy criterion).}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $\{f_n + g_n\}$ converges uniformly.}
    Given $\varepsilon > 0$.
    Since $\{f_n\}$ and $\{g_n\}$ converge uniformly,
    there exist two integers $N_1$ and $N_2$ such that
    \begin{align*}
      |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| \leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
      &\text{ whenever }
      n,m \geq N_1, x \in E \\
      |g_n(x) - g_m(x)| \leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
      &\text{ whenever }
      n,m \geq N_2, x \in E.
    \end{align*}
    Take $N = \max\{N_1,N_2\}$, we have
    \begin{align*}
      &|(f_n(x)+ g_n(x)) - (f_m(x) + g_m(x))| \\
      =& |(f_n(x) - f_n(x)) + (g_n(x) - g_m(x))| \\
      \leq& |f_n(x) - f_n(x)| + |g_n(x) - g_m(x)| \\
      \leq& \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
      =& \varepsilon

      n,m \geq N_2, x \in E.

    Take $N = \max\{N_1,N_2\}$, we have
    \begin{align*}
      &|f_n(x)g_n(x) - f_m(x)g_m(x)| \\
      =& |[f_n(x) - f_m(x)]g_n(x) + f_m(x)[g_n(x) - g_m(x)]| \\
      \leq& |f_n(x) - f_m(x)||g_n(x)| + |f_m(x)||g_n(x) - g_m(x)| \\

\textbf{Exercise 7.3.}
\emph{Construct sequences $\{f_n\}$, $\{g_n\}$ which converge uniformly on some set $E$,
but such that $\{f_n g_n\}$ does not converge uniformly on $E$
(of course, $\{f_n g_n\}$ must converge on $E$).} \\

We provides some examples here. \\

\emph{Proof ($f_n(x) = x + \frac{1}{n}$).}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  Define $\{f_n(x)\}$ on $E = \mathbb{R}$ by $f_n(x) = x + \frac{1}{n}$ and $f(x) = x$.
  Clearly, $\{f_n(x)\}$ converges to $f(x)$ pointwise.

  \item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly.}
  Given $\varepsilon > 0$.
  There exists an integer $N \geq \frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ such that
  \[
    |f_n(x) - f(x)| = \frac{1}{n} \leq \frac{1}{N} \leq \varepsilon
  \]
  whenever $n \geq N$ and $x \in E$.
  Hence $\{f_n\} \to f$ uniformly.

  \item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $\{f_n^2\}$ does not converge uniformly.}
  Clearly, $\{f_n(x)^2\}$ converges to $f(x)^2$ pointwise.
  Hence
  \[
    \sup_{x \in E} |f_n(x)^2 - f(x)^2|
    = \sup_{x \in E} \abs{\frac{2x}{n} + \frac{1}{n^2}}
    \to \infty
  \]
  as $n \to \infty$ (by considering $x = n^2 \in E$).
  Hence $\{f_n^2 \}$ does not converge uniformly (Theorem 7.9).
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Proof ($f_n(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, $g_n(x) = \frac{1}{n}$).}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  Let $E = (0,1)$.
  Let $\{f_n(x)\}$ on $E$ be $f_n(x) = \frac{1}{x}$
  and $\{g_n(x)\}$ on $E$ be $g_n(x) = \frac{1}{n}$.
  Clearly, $\{f_n(x)\}$ converges to $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ pointwise
  and $\{g_n(x)\}$ converges to $g(x) = 0$ pointwise.

  \item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly.}
  Given $\varepsilon > 0$.
  There exists an integer $N = 1$ such that
  \[
    |f_n(x) - f(x)| = 0 \leq \varepsilon
  \]
  whenever $n \geq N$ and $x \in E$.
  Hence $\{f_n\} \to f$ uniformly.

  \item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $\{g_n\}$ converges uniformly.}
  Given $\varepsilon > 0$.
  There exists an integer $N \geq \frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ such that
  \[
    |g_n(x) - g(x)| = \frac{1}{n} \leq \frac{1}{N} \leq \varepsilon
  \]
  whenever $n \geq N$ and $x \in E$.
  Hence $\{g_n\} \to g$ uniformly.

  \item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $\{f_n g_n\}$ does not converge uniformly.}
  Clearly, $\{f_n(x) g_n(x) \}$ converges to $f(x) g(x) = 0$ pointwise.
  Hence
  \[
    \sup_{x \in E} |f_n(x) g_n(x) - 0|
    = \sup_{x \in E} \abs{\frac{1}{nx}}
    \to \infty
  \]
  as $n \to \infty$ (by considering $x = \frac{1}{n^2} \in E$).
  Hence $\{f_n g_n \}$ does not converge uniformly (Theorem 7.9).
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Proof (Exercise 9.2 in Tom M. Apostol, Mathematical Analysis, 2nd edition).}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  Let $E = [\alpha,\beta] \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a bounded interval.
  Define two sequences $\{f_n\}$ and $\{g_n\}$ on $E$ as follows:
  \[
    f_n(x) = x \left( 1+\frac{1}{n} \right)
    \text{ if $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $n = 1,2,\cdots$},
  \]
  \begin{equation*}
  g_n(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      \frac{1}{n}   & \text{ if $x=0$ or if $x$ is irrational}, \\
      b+\frac{1}{n} & \text{ if $x$ is rational $\neq 0$, say $x=\frac{a}{b}$, $b>0$}.
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  Here we assume that $\mathrm{gcd}(a,b) = 1$.
  Clearly, $f(x) = x$ and
  \begin{equation*}
  g(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      0 & \text{ if $x=0$ or if $x$ is irrational}, \\
      b & \text{ if $x$ is rational $\neq 0$, say $x=\frac{a}{b}$, $b>0$}.
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  Let $M = \max\{|\alpha|,|\beta|\} \geq 0$.

  \item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly.}
  Given $\varepsilon > 0$.
  There exists an integer $N \geq \frac{M}{\varepsilon}$ such that
  \[
    |f_n(x) - f(x)| = \frac{|x|}{n} \leq \frac{M}{N} \leq \varepsilon
  \]
  whenever $n \geq N$ and $x \in E$.
  Hence $\{f_n\} \to f$ uniformly.

  \item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $\{g_n\}$ converges uniformly.}
  Given $\varepsilon > 0$.
  There exists an integer $N \geq \frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ such that
  \[
    |g_n(x) - g(x)| = \frac{1}{n} \leq \frac{1}{N} \leq \varepsilon
  \]
  whenever $n \geq N$ and $x \in E$.
  Hence $\{g_n\} \to g$ uniformly.

  \item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $\{f_n g_n\}$ does not converge uniformly.}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)]
      Clearly, $\{f_n(x) g_n(x) \}$ converges to $f(x)g(x)$ pointwise
      where
      \begin{equation*}
      f(x) g(x) =
        \begin{cases}
          0 & \text{ if $x=0$ or if $x$ is irrational}, \\
          a & \text{ if $x=\frac{a}{b}$ is rational $\neq 0$, $b>0$}.
        \end{cases}
      \end{equation*}

    \item[(b)]
      Note that
      \begin{equation*}
      f_n(x) g_n(x) =
        \begin{cases}
          \frac{x}{n} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)
            & \text{ if $x=0$ or if $x$ is irrational}, \\
          \left( a + \frac{x}{n} \right)\left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)
            & \text{ if $x=\frac{a}{b}$ is rational $\neq 0$, $b>0$}.
        \end{cases}
      \end{equation*}
      Therefore,
      \begin{equation*}
      f_n(x) g_n(x) - f(x) g(x) =
        \begin{cases}
          \frac{x}{n} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)
            & \text{ if $x=0$ or if $x$ is irrational}, \\
          \frac{x}{n} \left( 1 + b + \frac{1}{n} \right)
            & \text{ if $x=\frac{a}{b}$ is rational $\neq 0$, $b>0$}.
        \end{cases}
      \end{equation*}

    \item[(c)]
      Hence
      \begin{align*}
        \sup_{x \in E} |f_n(x) g_n(x) - f(x) g(x)|
        &\geq \sup_{x \in E \cap \mathbb{Q}} |f_n(x) g_n(x) - f(x) g(x)| \\
        &= \sup_{x \in E \cap \mathbb{Q}}
          \abs{a} \left( \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{bn} + \frac{1}{bn^2} \right) \\
        &\geq \sup_{x \in E \cap \mathbb{Q}}
          \abs{a} \left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \\
        &= \sup_{x \in E \cap \mathbb{Q}} \frac{\abs{a}}{n}.
      \end{align*}

    \item[(d)]
      \emph{Given any irrational number $\gamma \in E$,
      there exists a sequence
      \[
        \left\{ r_m = \frac{a_m}{b_m} \right\}
      \]
      of nonzero rational numbers in $E$ such that $\lim r_m = \gamma$.
      Show that $\{a_m\}$ is unbounded.}
      If it is true, we can find $x_n = r_{m_n} = \frac{a_{m_n}}{b_{m_n}}$
      such that $|a_{m_n}| \geq n^2$ and
      \[
        \sup_{x \in E} |f_n(x) g_n(x) - f(x) g(x)|
        \geq \sup_{x \in E \cap \mathbb{Q}} \frac{\abs{a}}{n}
        \geq \frac{n^2}{n}
        = n \to \infty
      \]
      as $n \to \infty$.

    \item[(e)]
      (Reductio ad absurdum)
      If $\{a_m\}$ were bounded, then there exists
      a \textbf{constant} subsequence of $\{a_{m_k}\}$
      such that $\lim a_{m_k} = a \in \mathbb{Z}$.
      Since $\lim_{m \to \infty} r_m = \gamma$, $\lim_{k \to \infty} r_{m_k} = \gamma$ or
      \[
        \lim_{k \to \infty} b_{m_k}
        = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_{m_k}}{r_{m_k}}
        = \frac{a}{\gamma}
      \]
      (it is well-defined since $r_{m_k}$ and $\gamma$ cannot be zero).
      Since all $b_{m_k}$ are positive integers,
      the limit $\lim b_{m_k} = b$ is a positive integer too,
      or $b = \frac{a}{\gamma} \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, or $\gamma = \frac{a}{b} \in \mathbb{Z}$,
      which is absurd.
  \end{enumerate}
  Therefore, $\{f_n g_n\}$ does not converge uniformly.

$\Box$ \\\\

Show that $\{f_n\}$ converges to a continuous function, but not uniformly.
Use the series $\sum f_n$ to show that absolute convergence, even for all $x$,

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
\emph{Show that $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = 0$.
Hence $\{f_n\}$ converges to a continuous function $0$ pointwise.}
Clearly, $f_n(x) = 0$ for all $x \not\in (0,1)$.
Next, for any fixed $x \in (0,1)$, there exists an integer $N > \frac{1}{x}$

\[

Let
\[

Thus, $f_m(x_n) = \delta_{mn}$, where $\delta_{mn}$ is Kronecker delta.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  \emph{(Definition 7.7.)}
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  If $\{f_n\}$ were convergent uniformly, then

Similar to (2).

\textbf{Exercise 7.6.}
\emph{Prove that the series
\[
  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n \frac{x^2+n}{n^2}

converges uniformly in every bounded interval,
but does not converge absolutely for any value of $x$.} \\

\emph{Proof (Dirichlet's test).}
Given any bounded interval $E = [\alpha,\beta] \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.
Write $f_n(x) = (-1)^n$ on $E$ and $g_n(x) = \frac{x^2+n}{n^2}$ on $E$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  The partial sums $F_n(x)$ of $\sum f_n(x)$ form a uniformly bounded sequence.

  \item[(2)]
  $g_1(x) \geq g_2(x) \geq \cdots$ since
  \[
    g_{n+1}(x)
    = \frac{x^2}{(n+1)^2} + \frac{1}{n+1}
    < \frac{x^2}{n^2} + \frac{1}{n}
    = g_n(x).
  \]

  \item[(3)]
  Write $M = \max\{|\alpha|,|\beta|\}$.
  Since
  \[
    |g_n(x)|
    = \frac{x^2}{n^2} + \frac{1}{n}
    \leq \frac{M^2}{n^2} + \frac{1}{n} \to \infty
  \]
  as $n \to \infty$,
  $\lim_{n \to \infty} g_n(x) = 0$.
  By Dirichlet's test (Exercise 7.11),
  $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_n(x) g_n(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n \frac{x^2+n}{n^2}$
  converges.

  \item[(4)]
  \begin{align*}
    \sum |f_n(x)|

    &\geq \sum \frac{n}{n^2} \\
    &= \sum \frac{1}{n} \to \log n + \gamma

$f_n(x)$ is defined on $\mathbb{R}$. \\

  \item[(2)]
  Clearly, $f'(x) = 0$.
  Since

\begin{enumerate}

Define $f_n(x) = c_n I(x-x_n)$ on $(a,b)$. So

  |f_n(x)| = |c_n| |I(x-x_n)| \leq |c_n|
  \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:
  (x \in (a,b), n = 1,2,3,\ldots).

Since $\sum|c_n|$ converges, $f = \sum f_n$ converges uniformly (Theorem 7.10).

\item[(2)]
Given any $p \in (a,b)$ with $p \neq x_n$ for all $n=1,2,3,\ldots$.
So each $I(x-x_n)$ is continuous at $x=p$, and thus
each partial sum $\sum_{n=1}^{N} f_n(x)$ is continuous.

\begin{align*}

$f(x)$ is continuous at $x=p$ too.

\textbf{Exercise 7.9.}
\emph{Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of continuous functions
which converges uniformly to a function $f$ on a set $E$.
Prove that
\[
  \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x_n) = f(x)
\]
for every sequence of points $x_n \in E$ such that $x_n \to x$,
and $x \in E$.
Is the converse of this true?} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  Given any $x \in E$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$.
  Since each $f_n$ is continuous and $f_n \to f$ uniformly,
  $f$ is continuous (Theorem 7.12).
  Hence as $x_n \to x$, there exists an integer $N_1$
  such that
  \[
    |f(x_n) - f(x)| \leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
    \text{ whenever } n \geq N_1
  \]
  (Theorem 4.2).
  Also, $f_n \to f$ uniformly implies that there exists an integer $N_2$
  such that
  \[
    |f_n(x_n) - f(x_n)| \leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
    \text{ whenever } n \geq N_2.
  \]
  Let $N = \max\{N_1,N_2\}$ be an integer.
  Then
  \[
    |f_n(x_n) - f(x)|
    \leq |f_n(x_n) - f(x_n)| + |f(x_n) - f(x)|
    \leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
    = \varepsilon
  \]
  whenever $n \geq N$.
  Therefore, $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x_n) = f(x)$.

  \item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that the converse is false.}
  Let $E = (0,1)$ and $f_n = \frac{1}{nx}$ on $E$.
  Given any $x \in E$.
  First,
  \[
    f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{nx} = 0
  \]
  Next, for each sequence of points $x_n \in E$ such that $x_n \to x$
  (note that each $x_n \neq 0$ and $x \neq 0$), we have
  \[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x_n)
    = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{nx_n}
    = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{x_n}
    = 0 \cdot \frac{1}{x}
    = 0.
  \]
  Hence $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x_n) = f(x) = 0$.
  However, $\{f_n\}$ does not converge uniformly.
  (See \emph{Proof ($f_n(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, $g_n(x) = \frac{1}{n}$)} in Exercise 7.3.)

  \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:
  (x \in \mathbb{R}).
\]
Find all discontinuities of $f$, and show that they form a countable dense set.
Show that $f$ is nevertheless Riemann-integrable on every bounded interval.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
Let $f_n(x) = \frac{(nx)}{n^2}$ on $\mathbb{R}$,
$F_n(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} f_k(x)$ on $\mathbb{R}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
Since
\[
  \abs{f_n(x)} = \abs{ \frac{(nx)}{n^2} } \leq \frac{1}{n^2}
\]
for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and $n=1,2,3,\ldots$
and $\sum \frac{1}{n^2}$ converges (to $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$),
$F_n = \sum f_k$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $\mathbb{R}$ (Theorem 7.10).

\item[(2)]
Note that $(x)$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Z}$
and not continuous on $\mathbb{Z}$ (Exercise 4.16).
Now we define $E_n = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : nx \in \mathbb{Z}\}$.
So $E_1 = \mathbb{Z}$, and
\[
  \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n = \mathbb{Q}.
\]
So $f_n$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R} - E_n$
and not continuous on $E_n$.
So $F_n = \sum f_k$ is continuous on
$\mathbb{R} - \bigcup_{k=1}^{n} E_k
\supseteq \mathbb{R}$ - $\mathbb{Q}$.

\item[(3)]
\emph{Show that $f(x)$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ - $\mathbb{Q}$.}
Since
$\{F_n\}$ is a sequence of continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}$ - $\mathbb{Q}$ (by (2))

$f$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ - $\mathbb{Q}$ (Theorem 7.12).

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  If there were $p = \frac{a}{b} \in \mathbb{Q}$
  with $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$, $(a,b) = 1$ and $b > 0$
  such that $f(x)$ is continuous at $x = p$,
  then
  \[
    \lim_{x \to p^{-}} f(x) = \lim_{x \to p^{+}} f(x).
  \]

  \item[(b)]
  As $b \mid n$, say $n = bq$ for some $q \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    \lim_{x \to p^{-}} f_n(x)
    &= \lim_{x \to p^{-}} \frac{1}{b^2 q^2}
    = \frac{1}{b^2 q^2}, \\
    \lim_{x \to p^{+}} f_n(x)
    &= \lim_{x \to p^{+}} \frac{0}{b^2 q^2}
    = 0.
  \end{align*}
  As $b \nmid n$,
  \[
    \lim_{x \to p^{-}} f_n(x) = \lim_{x \to p^{+}} f_n(x) = f_n(p).
  \]
  Thus,
  \[
    \lim_{x \to p^{-}} F_n(x) - \lim_{x \to p^{+}} F_n(x)
    = \frac{1}{b^2} \sum_{q = 1}^{[\frac{n}{b}]} \frac{1}{q^2}.
  \]

  \item[(c)]
  Since $F_n \to f$ uniformly, given $\varepsilon = \frac{64}{1989 b^2} > 0$,
  there exists an integer $N'$ such that
  \[
    \abs{ \sum_{n=m}^{\infty} f_n(x) }
    = \sum_{n=m}^{\infty} f_n(x)
    \leq \frac{64}{1989 b^2}

  whenever $m \geq N'$.

  Take $N = \max\{N', b\}$.
  \begin{align*}

\emph{Theorem 3.42 (Dirichlet's test).}
Suppose
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  the partial sums $A_n$ of $\sum a_n$ form a bounded sequence;
  \item[(b)]
  $b_0 \geq b_1 \geq b_2 \geq \cdots$;
  \item[(c)]
  $\lim_{n \to \infty} b_n = 0$.
\end{enumerate}
Then $\sum a_n b_n$ converges. \\



\emph{Proof (Theorem 3.42).}
Let $F_n(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} f_k(x)$.
Choose $M$ such that $|F_n(x)| \leq M$ for all $n$, all $x \in E$.
Given $\varepsilon > 0$,
there is an integer $N$ such that $g_N(x) \leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2(M+1)}$ for all $x \in E$.
For $N \leq p \leq q$, we have
\begin{align*}
  &\abs{\sum_{n=p}^{q} f_n(x) g_n(x)} \\
  =& \abs{\sum_{n=p}^{q-1} F_n(x)(g_n(x)-g_{n+1}(x)) + F_q(x)g_q(x) - F_{p-1}(x)g_p(x)} \\
  \leq& M \abs{\sum_{n=p}^{q-1}(g_n(x)-g_{n+1}(x)) + g_q(x) + g_p(x)} \\
  =& 2M g_p(x) \\
  \leq& 2M g_N(x) \\
  \leq& \varepsilon
\end{align*}
for all $x \in E$.
Uniformly convergence now follows from the Cauchy criterion (Theorem 7.8).
Note that the first inequality in the above chain depends of course on the fact that
$g_n(x) - g_{n+1}(x) \geq 0$.

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
Since $\int_{0}^{1} f(x) x^n dx = 0$ for all $n = 0,1,2,\ldots$,
\[
  \int_{0}^{1} f(x) P(x) dx = 0 \text{ for all } P(x) \in \mathbb{R}[x].

there exists a sequence of $P_n(x) \in \mathbb{R}[x]$ such that
\[
  P_n(x) \to f(x)

Since $f(x)$ is continuous on the compact set $[0,1]$, $f(x)$ is bounded on $[0,1]$.
Hence
\[
  f(x) P_n(x) \to f^2(x)

uniformly on $[0,1]$.

Since each $f(x) P_n(x)$ is continuous,
