\textbf{Exercise 5.1.}
\emph{Let $f$ be defined for all real $x$, and suppose that
$$|f(x) - f(y)| \leq (x - y)^2$$
for all real $x$ and $y$. Prove that $f$ is a constant.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
Write
\[
  \left| \frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} \right| \leq |x - y|
\]
if $x \neq y$.

\item[(2)]
Given any $y \in \mathbb{R}$,
\[
  \abs{ \frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} } \to 0 \:\: \text{ as } \:\: x \to y,
\]
or $|f'(y)| = 0$.

\item[(3)]
Or using $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ argument. Fix $y \in \mathbb{R}$.
Given any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta = \varepsilon > 0$ such that
$$\left| \frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} - 0 \right| \leq |x - y| < \delta = \varepsilon$$
whenever $|x - y| < \delta$. That is, $|f'(y)| = 0$.

\item[(4)]
So $f'(y) = 0$ for any $y \in \mathbb{R}$.
By Theorem 5.11 (b), $f$ is a constant.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\textbf{Exercise 5.2.}
\emph{Suppose $f'(x)>0$ in $(a,b)$.
Prove that $f$ is strictly increasing in $(a,b)$, and let $g$ be its inverse function.
Prove that $g$ is differentiable, and that
\[
  g'(f(x)) = \frac{1}{f'(x)} \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: (a<x<b).
\]}

\emph{Proof.}
Let $E = (a,b)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
Theorem 5.10 implies that
for any $a < p < q < b$ there exists $\xi \in (p,q)$ such that
\[
  f(p)-f(q) = (p-q)f'(\xi).
\]
Since $\xi \in (p,q) \subseteq E$, by assumption $f'(\xi) > 0$.
Hence $f(p)-f(q) = (p-q)f'(\xi) < 0$ (here $p-q < 0$), or
\[
  f(p) < f(q)
\]
if $p < q$.
Therefore, $f$ is strictly increasing in $(a,b)$.

\item[(2)]
\emph{Show that $f$ is one-to-one in $E$ if $f$ is strictly increasing in $E$.}
If $f(p) = f(q)$, then it cannot be $p > q$ or $p < q$ ((1)).
So that $p = q$, or $f$ is injective.

\item[(3)]
\emph{Show that $g$ is well-defined.}
Theorem 5.2 and Theorem 4.17.

\item[(4)]
\emph{Show that $ g'(f(x)) = \frac{1}{f'(x)}$.}
Given $y \in f(E)$, say $y = f(x)$ for some $x \in E$.
Given any $s \in f(E)$ with $s \neq y$.
Here $s = f(t)$ for some $t \in E$ and $t \neq x$.
\begin{align*}
  \lim_{s \to y} \frac{g(s) - g(y)}{s - y}
  &= \lim_{f(t) \to f(x)} \frac{g(f(t)) - g(f(x))}{f(t) - f(x)} \\
  &= \lim_{t \to x} \frac{t - x}{f(t) - f(x)} \\
  &= \lim_{t \to x} \frac{1}{\frac{f(t) - f(x)}{t - x}} \\
  &=\frac{1}{f'(x)}.
    &(f' > 0)
\end{align*}
Here $s \to y$ if and only if $t \to x$ since both $f$ and $g$
are continuous and one-to-one.
Hence $g$ is differentiable and $g'(f(x)) = \frac{1}{f'(x)}$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\textbf{Exercise 5.3.}
\emph{Suppose $g$ is a real function on $\mathbb{R}^1$,
with bounded derivative (say $|g'|\leq M$).
Fix $\varepsilon > 0$, and define $f(x)=x+\varepsilon g(x)$.
Prove that $f$ is one-to-one if $\varepsilon$ is small enough.
(A set of admissible values of $\varepsilon$ can be determined which depends only on $M$.)} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
Note that
$f'(x) = 1 + \varepsilon g'(x)$ (Theorem 5.3).
Since $|g'|\leq M$,
\[
  1 - \varepsilon M \leq f'(x) \leq 1 + \varepsilon M.
\]

\item[(2)]
Pick
\[
  \varepsilon = \frac{1}{M+1} > 0.
\]
Thus,
\[
  f'(x) \geq \frac{1}{M+1} > 0.
\]
By Exercise 5.2, $f(x)$ is strictly increasing in $\mathbb{R}$ or one-to-one in $\mathbb{R}$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\textbf{Exercise 5.4.}
\emph{If
$$C_0 + \frac{C_1}{2} + \cdots + \frac{C_{n- 1}}{n} + \frac{C_n}{n + 1} = 0,$$
where $C_0, ..., C_n$ are real constants, prove that the equation
$$C_0 + C_1 x + \cdots + C_{n - 1} x^{n - 1} + C_n x^n = 0$$
has at least one real root between $0$ and $1$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
Let
$$g(x) = C_0 x + \frac{C_1}{2} x^2 + \cdots + \frac{C_{n- 1}}{n} x^n + \frac{C_n}{n + 1} x^{n + 1}
\in \mathbb{R}[x].$$
Then $g(0) = g(1) = 0$, and
$g'(x) = C_0 + C_1 x + \cdots + C_{n - 1} x^{n - 1} + C_n x^n$.
By the mean value theorem (Theorem 5.10), there exists a point $\xi \in (0, 1)$ at which
$$g(1) - g(0) = g'(\xi)(1 - 0),$$
or $g'(\xi) = 0.$ That is, there exists a real root $x = \xi$ between $0$ and $1$
at which $C_0 + C_1 x + \cdots + C_{n - 1} x^{n - 1} + C_n x^n = 0$.
$\Box$ \\\\



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\textbf{Exercise 5.5.}
\emph{Suppose $f$ is defined and differentiable for every $x > 0$,
and $f'(x) \to 0$ as $x \to +\infty$.
Put $g(x) = f(x+1) - f(x)$.
Prove that $g(x) \to 0$ as $x \to +\infty$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
Given any $x > 0$.
Since f is differentiable for every $x > 0$,
f is differentiable on $[x,x+1]$.
By Theorem 5.2 and Theorem 5.10 (the mean value theorem),
there is a point $\xi \in (x,x+1)$ at which
\[
  f(x+1) - f(x) = [(x+1) - x ]f'(\xi)
\]
or
\[
  g(x) = f'(\xi).
\]
As $x \to +\infty$, $\xi \to +\infty$.
Hence
\[
  \lim_{x \to +\infty} g(x)
  = \lim_{\xi \to +\infty} f'(\xi) = 0.
\]
$\Box$ \\\\

\textbf{Exercise 5.6.}
\emph{Suppose}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  \emph{$f$ is continuous for $x \geq 0$},

  \item[(b)]
  \emph{$f'(x)$ exists for $x > 0$},

  \item[(c)]
  \emph{$f(0) = 0$},

  \item[(d)]
  \emph{$f'$ is monotonically increasing.}
\end{enumerate}
\emph{Put
\[
  g(x) = \frac{f(x)}{x} \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: (x>0)
\]
and prove that $g$ is monotonically increasing.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  It suffices to show that $g'(x) \geq 0$ for $x>0$ (Theorem 5.11(a)),
  that is, to show that
  \[
    g'(x) = \frac{x f'(x) - f(x)}{x^2} \geq 0 \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: (x>0),
  \]
  or
  \[
    x f'(x) - f(x) \geq 0 \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: (x>0)
  \]
  since $x^2 > 0$ for all nonzero $x$.

  \item[(2)]
  Given $x > 0$.
  By (a)(b), we apply the mean value theorem (Theorem 5.10) on $f$ to get
  \[
    f(x) - f(0) = (x - 0)f'(\xi)
  \]
  for some $\xi \in (0,x)$.
  By (c),
  \[
    f(x) = x f'(\xi).
  \]
  By (d),
  \[
    f(x) = x f'(\xi) \leq x f'(x).
  \]
  Hence $x f'(x) - f(x) \geq 0$,
  or $g$ is monotonically increasing.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Note.}
$g$ is increasing strictly if $f$ is increasing strictly. \\\\



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\textbf{Exercise 5.7.}
\emph{Suppose $f'(x)$, $g'(x)$ exist, $g'(x) \neq 0$, and $f(x) = g(x) = 0$.
Prove that
\[
  \lim_{t \to x}{\frac{f(t)}{g(t)}} = \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.
\]
(This holds also for complex functions.)} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{align*}
  \frac{f'(t)}{g'(t)}
  &= \frac{\lim_{t \to x}{\frac{f(t)-f(x)}{t-x}}}{\lim_{t \to x}{\frac{g(t)-g(x)}{t-x}}} \\
  &= \lim_{t \to x} \frac{{\frac{f(t)-f(x)}{t-x}}}{{\frac{g(t)-g(x)}{t-x}}}
    &\text{(Both limits exist and $g' \neq 0$)} \\
  &= \lim_{t \to x} \frac{f(t)}{g(t)}.
    &\text{($f(x)=g(x)=0$)}
\end{align*}
This proof is also true for complex functions.
$\Box$ \\\\



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\textbf{Exercise 5.8.}
\emph{Suppose $f'(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $\varepsilon > 0$.
Prove that there exists $\delta > 0$ such that
\[
  \abs{ \frac{f(t)-f(x)}{t-x} - f'(x) } < \varepsilon
\]
whenever $0 < |t-x| < \delta$, $a \leq x \leq b$, $a \leq t \leq b$.
(This could be expressed by saying $f$ is \textbf{uniformly differentiable}
on $[a,b]$ if $f'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.)
Does this hold for vector-valued functions too?} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  Since $f'(x)$ is continuous on a compact set $[a,b]$,
  $f'(x)$ is uniformly continuous on $[a,b]$.
  So given any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that
  \[
    | f'(t) - f'(x) | < \varepsilon
  \]
  whenever $0 < |t-x| < \delta$, $a \leq x \leq b$, $a \leq t \leq b$.

  \item[(2)]
  For such $t < x$ in (1),
  by the mean value theorem (Theorem 5.10),
  there exists a point $\xi \in (t,x)$
  at which
  \[
    f'(\xi) = \frac{f(t)-f(x)}{t-x}.
  \]
  Note that $\xi$ is also satisfying $0 < |t-\xi| < |t-x| < \delta$
  and $a \leq \xi \leq b$.
  Hence by (1) we also have
  \[
    | f'(\xi) - f'(x) | < \varepsilon,
  \]
  or
  \[
    \abs{ \frac{f(t)-f(x)}{t-x} - f'(x) } < \varepsilon.
  \]

  \item[(3)]
  \emph{Suppose $\mathbf{f}'(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $\varepsilon > 0$.
  Prove that there exists $\delta > 0$ such that
  \[
    \abs{ \frac{\mathbf{f}(t)-\mathbf{f}(x)}{t-x} - \mathbf{f}'(x) } < \varepsilon
  \]
  whenever $0 < |t-x| < \delta$, $a \leq x \leq b$, $a \leq t \leq b$.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  Write
  \[
    \mathbf{f}(x) = (f_1(x), \ldots, f_k(x)) \in \mathbb{R}^k.
  \]
  By Remarks 5.16,
  $\mathbf{f}(x)$ is differentiable at a point $x$ if and only if
  each $f_1, \ldots, f_k$ is differentiable at $x$.
  So that
  \[
    \mathbf{f}'(x) = (f_1'(x), \ldots, f_k'(x)) \in \mathbb{R}^k.
  \]
  By Theorem 4.10,
  $\mathbf{f}'(x)$ is continuous if and only if
  each $f_1, \ldots, f_k$ is continuous.

  \item[(b)]
  Similar to (1)(2),
  Since $f_i'(x)$ is continuous on a compact set $[a,b]$ where $1 \leq i \leq k$,
  $f_i'(x)$ is uniformly continuous on $[a,b]$.
  So given any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta_i > 0$ such that
  \[
    | f_i'(t) - f_i'(x) | < \frac{\varepsilon}{\sqrt{k}}
  \]
  whenever $0 < |t-x| < \delta_i$, $a \leq x \leq b$, $a \leq t \leq b$.
  Take $\delta = \min_{1 \leq i \leq k} \delta_i > 0$.

  \item[(c)]
  For such $t < x$ in (1),
  by the mean value theorem (Theorem 5.10),
  there exists a point $\xi_i \in (t,x)$
  at which
  \[
    f_i'(\xi_i) = \frac{f_i(t)-f_i(x)}{t-x}.
  \]
  Note that $\xi_i$ is also satisfying $0 < |t-\xi_i| < |t-x| < \delta$
  and $a \leq \xi_i \leq b$.
  Hence by (1) we also have
  \[
    | f_i'(\xi_i) - f_i'(x) | < \frac{\varepsilon}{\sqrt{k}},
  \]
  or
  \[
    \abs{ \frac{f_i(t)-f_i(x)}{t-x} - f_i'(x) } < \frac{\varepsilon}{\sqrt{k}}.
  \]

  \item[(d)]
  Hence
  \[
    \abs{ \frac{\mathbf{f}(t)-\mathbf{f}(x)}{t-x} - \mathbf{f}'(x) }
    = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{k} \abs{ \frac{f_i(t)-f_i(x)}{t-x} - f_i'(x) }^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
    < \varepsilon.
  \]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\

\textbf{Exercise 5.9.}
\emph{Let $f$ be a continuous real function on $\mathbb{R}^1$,
of which it is known that $f'(x)$ exists for all $x \neq 0$ and that $f'(x) \to 3$ as $x \to 0$.
Dose it follow that $f'(0)$ exists?} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $f'(0) = 3$.}
  It is equivalent to show that
  \[
    \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{f(x) - f(0)}{x - 0} = 3.
  \]
  Write $F(x) = f(x) - f(0)$ and $G(x) = x - 0$ on $\mathbb{R}^1$.
  So that
  \[
    \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{f(x) - f(0)}{x - 0} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{F(x)}{G(x)} = 0.
  \]

  \item[(2)]
  Note that
    \[
      \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{F'(x)}{G'(x)}
      = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{f'(x)}{1}
      = 3.
    \]

  \item[(3)]
  Since $f$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}^1$,
  $F$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}^1$.
  Hence
    \[
      \lim_{x \to 0} F(x) = F(\lim_{x \to 0} x) = F(0) = 0.
    \]
  Also, $G$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}^1$ implies that
    \[
      \lim_{x \to 0} G(x) = G(\lim_{x \to 0} x) = G(0) = 0.
    \]

  \item[(4)]
  Apply L'Hospital's rule (Theorem 5.13) to (2)(3), we have
  \[
    \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{F(x)}{G(x)} = 3,
  \]
  or $f'(0) = 3$.

$\Box$ \\\\

\textbf{Exercise 5.10.}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\textbf{Exercise 5.11.}
\emph{Suppose $f$ is defined in a neighborhood of $x$, and suppose $f''(x)$ exists.
Show that
\[
  \lim_{h \to 0}{\frac{f(x+h) + f(x-h) - 2f(x)}{h^2}} = f''(x).
\]
Show by an example that the limit may exist even if $f''(x)$ dose not.
(Hint: Use Theorem 5.13.)} \\

\emph{Proof (Theorem 5.13).}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  Write $F(h) = f(x+h) + f(x-h) - 2f(x)$ and $G(h) = h^2$.
  It is equivalent to show that
  \[
    \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{F(h)}{G(h)} = f''(x).
  \]
  We might apply Theorem 5.13 (L'Hospital rule) to get it.

  \item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $\lim_{h \to 0} F(h) = 0$ and $\lim_{h \to 0} G(h) = 0$.}
  It is clear that $\lim_{h \to 0} G(h) = \lim_{h \to 0} h^2 = 0$
  since $x \mapsto x^2$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}^1$.
  Besides, since $f$ is continuous at $x$ (by applying Theorem 5.2 twice),
  \[
    \lim_{h \to 0} F(h)
    = f(x) + f(x) - 2f(x)
    = 0.
  \]

  \item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that
  \[
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{F'(h)}{G'(h)} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x+h) - f'(x-h)}{2h}
  \]
  is well-defined.}
  Since $f''(x)$ exists in a neighborhood $B(x;r)$ of $x$ (where $r > 0$),
  $f'(x)$ exists and is continuous in $B(x;r)$ (Theorem 5.2).
  As $0 < |h| < \frac{r}{2}$,
  \[
    x+h \in B\left(x+h;\frac{r}{2}\right) \subseteq B(x;r)
  \]
  and
  \[
    x-h \in B\left(x-h;\frac{r}{2}\right) \subseteq B(x;r).
  \]
  So $f'(x+h)$ and $f'(x-h)$ exist in $B(x;r)$ as $0 < |h| < \frac{r}{2}$.
  Hence
  \[
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{F'(h)}{G'(h)}
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x+h) - f'(x-h)}{2h}
  \]
  is well-defined (Theorem 5.3 and Theorem 5.5 (the chain rule)).

  \item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that
  \[
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x+h) - f'(x-h)}{2h} = f''(x).
  \]}

  Since $f''(x)$ exists, by definition
  \[
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x+h) - f'(x)}{h} = f''(x)
  \]
  and
  \[
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x-h) - f'(x)}{-h} = f''(x).
  \]
  Sum up two expressions to get
  \[
    2 f''(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x-h) - f'(x-h)}{h}.
  \]

  \item[(5)]
  By (2)(3)(4) and Theorem 5.13 (L'Hospital rule),
  the result is established.

  \item[(6)]
  \emph{Given $f(x) = x|x|$ on $\mathbb{R}^1$.
  Show that
  \[
    \lim_{h \to 0}{\frac{f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)}{h^2}} = 0
  \]
  but $f''(x)$ does not exist at $x = 0$.}
  Clearly,
  \begin{align*}
    \lim_{h \to 0}{\frac{f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)}{h^2}}
    &= \lim_{h \to 0}{\frac{h|h| + (-h)|-h| - 2 \cdot 0}{h^2}} \\
    &= \lim_{h \to 0}{\frac{h|h| - h|h| - 0}{h^2}} \\
    &= \lim_{h \to 0}{0} \\
    &= 0.

  But $f''(x)$ does not exist by Exercise 5.12.

$\Box$ \\\\

\textbf{Exercise 5.12.}
\emph{If $f(x) = |x|^3$, compute $f'(x)$, $f''(x)$ for all real $x$,
and show that $f^{(3)} (0)$ does not exist.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  Write
  \begin{equation*}
    f(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      x^3 & (x \geq 0), \\
      -x^3 & (x \leq 0).
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}

  \item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $f'(x) = 3x|x|$.}
  It is trivial that
  \begin{equation*}
    f'(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      3x^2 & (x > 0), \\
      -3x^2 & (x < 0).
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  Note that
  \[
    \lim_{x \to 0} f'(x) = 0.
  \]
  Apply the same argument in Exercise 5.9, we have
  \[
    f'(0) = 0.
  \]
  Hence $f'$ exists and $f'(x) = 3x|x|$ for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

  \item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $f''(x) = 6|x|$.}
  Similar to (2).
  \begin{equation*}
    f''(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      6x & (x > 0), \\
      -6x & (x < 0).
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  Note that
  \[
    \lim_{x \to 0} f''(x) = 0.
  \]
  Apply the same argument in Exercise 5.9, we have
  \[
    f''(0) = 0.
  \]
  Hence $f''$ exists and $f''(x) = 6|x|$ for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

  \item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $f^{(3)} (0)$ does not exist.}
  \begin{equation*}
    f'''(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      6 & (x > 0), \\
      -6 & (x < 0).
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}

  There are some proofs for showing that $f^{(3)} (0)$ does not exist.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  Since
  \[
    \lim_{t \to 0+} \frac{f''(t) - f''(0)}{t - 0}
    = \lim_{t \to 0+} \frac{6t}{t} = 6
  \]
  and
  \[
    \lim_{t \to 0-} \frac{f''(t) - f''(0)}{t - 0}
    = \lim_{t \to 0-} \frac{-6t}{t} = -6,
  \]
  $f^{(3)} (0)$ does not exist.

  \item[(b)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  If $f$ were differentiable on $\mathbb{R}^1$,
  then
  \[
    \lim_{t \to 0+} f'''(t) = 6
  \]

\textbf{Exercise 5.14.}
\emph{Let $f$ be a differentiable real function defined in $(a,b)$.
Prove that $f$ is convex if and only if $f'$ is monotonically increasing.
Assume next $f''(x)$ exists for every $x \in (a,b)$,
and prove that $f$ is convex if and only if $f''(x) \geq 0$ for all $x \in (a,b)$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Show that $f'$ is monotonically increasing if $f$ is convex.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  Since $f$ is convex, by definition (Exercise 4.23)
  \[
    f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda) y) \leq \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda) f(y)
  \]
  whenever $a < x < b$, $a < y < b$, $0 < \lambda < 1$.

  \item[(b)]
  As $x \neq y$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    f(y) - f(x)
    &\geq \frac{f(x + \lambda(y-x)) - f(x)}{\lambda} \\
    &= \frac{f(x + \lambda(y-x)) - f(x)}{\lambda(y-x)} \cdot (y-x)
  \end{align*}
  and let $\lambda \to 0$ to get
  \[
    f(y) - f(x) \geq f'(x)(y - x)
  \]
  (since $f'(x)$ exists).
  Similarly, we have
  \[
    f(x) - f(y) \geq f'(y)(x - y).
  \]

  \item[(c)]
  Given any $y > x$, we have
  \[
    f'(y)(y - x) \geq f(y) - f(x) \geq f'(x)(y - x).
  \]
  Hence $f'(y) \geq f'(x)$ whenever $y > x$,
  or $f'$ is monotonically increasing.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $f$ is convex if $f'$ is monotonically increasing.}
  Given any $y > x$ and any $0 < \lambda < 1$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  By Theorem 5.10 (the mean value theorem), there is a point $x < \xi < y$ such that
  \[
    f(y) - f(x) = f'(\xi)(y - x).
  \]
  Since $f'$ is monotonically increasing,
  \[
    f'(y)(y - x) \geq f(y) - f(x) \geq f'(x)(y - x).
  \]

  \item[(b)]
  Write $z = \lambda x + (1-\lambda)y$.
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    f(y)-f(z) &\geq f'(z)(y-z), \\
    f(z)-f(x) &\leq f'(z)(z-x),
  \end{align*}
  or
  \begin{align*}
    f(y) &\geq f(z) + f'(z)(y-z), \\
    f(x) &\geq f(z) + f'(z)(x-z),
  \end{align*}
  or
  \begin{align*}
    \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda)f(y)
    \geq&
    \lambda [f(z) + f'(z)(x-z)] \\
      &+ (1-\lambda)[f(z) + f'(z)(y-z)] \\
    =& f(z) \\
    =& f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y).
  \end{align*}
  Hence $f$ is convex.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(3)]
  \emph{Show that $f''(x) \geq 0$ if $f$ is convex and $f''$ exists.}
  By (1), $f'$ is monotonically increasing since $f$ is convex.
  Given any $x \neq y$, we have
  \[
    \frac{f'(y)-f'(x)}{y - x} \geq 0.
  \]
  Let $y \to x$, we have $f''(x) \geq 0$ if $f''$ exists.

\item[(4)]
  \emph{Show that $f$ is convex if $f''$ exists and $f''(x) \geq 0$.}
  By Theorem 5.11(a), $f'$ is monotonically increasing.
  By (2), $f$ is convex.

\textbf{Exercise 5.15 (Landau-Kolmogorov inequality on the half-line).}
\emph{Suppose $a \in \mathbb{R}^1$,
$f$ is a twice-differentiable real function on $(a,\infty)$,
and $M_0$, $M_1$, $M_2$ are the least upper bounds of
$|f(x)|$, $|f'(x)|$, $|f''(x)|$, respectively, on $(a,\infty)$.
Prove that
\[
  M_1^2 \leq 4 M_0 M_2.

\[
  |f'(x)| \leq h M_2 + \frac{M_0}{h}.)

\emph{To show that $M_1^2=4 M_0 M_2$ can actually happen, take $a=-1$, define
\begin{equation*}
  f(x) =

\emph{Does $M_1 ^2 \leq 4 M_0 M_2$ hold for vector-valued functions too?} \\



\emph{Note.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
Write
\[
  M_1 \leq 2 M_0^{\frac{1}{2}} M_2^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\]
$2$ is called the Landau-Kolmogorov constant,
which is the best possible by the above example.

\item[(2)]
In general,
suppose $a \in \mathbb{R}^1$,
$f$ is a $n$th differentiable real function on $(a,\infty)$,
and $M_0$, $M_k$, $M_n$ are the least upper bounds of
$\abs{ f(x) }$, $\abs{ f^{(k)}(x) }$, $\abs{ f^{(n)}(x) }$, respectively, on $(a,\infty)$
where $1 \leq k < n$.
Then
\[
  M_k \leq C(n,k) M_0^{1 - \frac{k}{n}} M_n^{\frac{k}{n}}.
\]
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Consider some trivial cases.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  If $M_0 = 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ on $(a,+\infty)$.
  So that $f'(x) = f''(x) = 0$ on $(a,+\infty)$, or $M_1 = M_2 = 0$.
  The inequality holds.

  \item[(b)]
  If $M_2 = 0$, then $f''(x) = 0$ on $(a,+\infty)$.
  So that $f'(x) = \alpha$ for some constant $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^1$ (Theorem 5.11(b)),
  and $f(x) = \alpha x + \beta$ for some constant $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^1$
  (by applying Theorem 5.11(b) to $x \mapsto f(x) - \alpha x$).
  Hence $M_1 = |\alpha|$ and
  \begin{equation*}
  M_0 =
    \begin{cases}
      +\infty & (\alpha \neq 0), \\
      |\beta| & (\alpha = 0).
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  In any case, the inequality holds.

  \item[(c)]
  If $M_0 = +\infty$ and $M_2 \neq 0$, there is nothing to do.

  \item[(d)]
  If $M_2 = +\infty$ and $M_0 \neq 0$, there is nothing to do.
  \end{enumerate}

\item[(2)]
By (1), we suppose that $0 < M_0 < +\infty$ and $0 < M_2 < +\infty$.
Given $x \in (a,+\infty)$ and $h>0$.
By Taylor's theorem (Theorem 5.15):
\[
  f(x+2h) = f(x) + 2h f'(x) + 2 h^2 f''(\xi)
\]
for some $\xi \in (x,x+2h) \subseteq (a,+\infty)$.
Thus
\begin{align*}
  2h|f'(x)|
  &\leq |f(x+2h)| + |f(x)| + 2 h^2 |f''(\xi)| \\
  &\leq 2 M_0 + 2 h^2 M_2, \\
  |f'(x)|
  &\leq \frac{M_0}{h} + h M_2
\end{align*}
holds for all $h > 0$.
In particular, take
\[
  h = \sqrt{\frac{M_0}{M_2}}
\]
to get
\[
  |f'(x)| \leq 2 \sqrt{M_0 M_2}.
\]
Thus $2 \sqrt{M_0 M_2}$ is an upper bound of $|f'(x)|$ for all $x \in (a,+\infty)$.
Hence
\[
  M_1 \leq 2 \sqrt{M_0 M_2}
\]
or
\[
  M_1^2 \leq 4 M_0 M_2.
\]

\item[(3)]
\emph{Define
\begin{equation*}
  f(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      2x^2 - 1            & (-1 < x < 0), \\
      \frac{x^2-1}{x^2+1} & (0 \leq x < \infty).
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
Show that $M_0 = 1$, $M_1 = 4$, $M_2 = 4$.}
Similar to Exercise 5.12,
\begin{equation*}
  f'(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      4x                   & (-1 < x \leq 0), \\
      \frac{4x}{(x^2+1)^2} & (0 \leq x < \infty).
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
(Here $\lim_{x \to 0+} f'(x) = 0$ and $\lim_{x \to 0-} f'(x) = 0$.
So $f'(0) = 0$ by Exercise 5.9.)
Also,
\begin{equation*}
  f''(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      4                          & (-1 < x \leq 0), \\
      \frac{-12x^2+4}{(x^2+1)^3} & (0 \leq x < \infty).
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
(Here $\lim_{x \to 0+} f''(x) = 4$ and $\lim_{x \to 0-} f''(x) = 4$.
So $f''(0) = 4$ by Exercise 5.9.)
Hence, $M_0 = 1$, $M_1 = 4$, $M_2 = 4$.

\item[(4)]
\emph{Given
\[
  \mathbf{f}(x) = (f_1(x), \ldots, f_k(x))
\]
be a twice-differentiable vector-valued function from $(a,\infty)$ to $\mathbb{R}^k$.
and $M_0$, $M_1$, $M_2$ are the least upper bounds of
$|\mathbf{f}(x)|$, $|\mathbf{f}'(x)|$, $|\mathbf{f}''(x)|$, respectively, on $(a,\infty)$.
Show that
\[
  M_1^2 \leq 4 M_0 M_2.
\]}

Similar to (1), we suppose that $0 < M_0 < +\infty$ and $0 < M_2 < +\infty$.
Given any $\mathbf{v} = (v_1, \ldots, v_k) \in \mathbb{R}^k$,
$\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{f}$ is a twice-differentiable real function on $(a,\infty)$.
Similar to (2),
Given $x \in (a,+\infty)$ and $h>0$.
By Taylor's theorem (Theorem 5.15):
\[
  (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{f})(x+2h)
  = (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{f})(x)
    + 2h (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{f})'(x)
    + 2 h^2 (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{f})''(\xi)
\]
for some $\xi \in (x,x+2h) \subseteq (a,+\infty)$.
Thus by the Schwarz inequality (Theorem 1.35)
\begin{align*}
  2h|(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{f})'(x)|
  &\leq |(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{f})(x+2h)|
    + |(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{f})(x)|
    + 2 h^2 |(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{f})''(\xi)| \\
  &\leq |\mathbf{v}| |\mathbf{f}(x+2h)|
    + |\mathbf{v}||\mathbf{f}(x)|
    + 2 h^2 |\mathbf{v}| |\mathbf{f}''(\xi)| \\
  &\leq (2 M_0 + 2 h^2 M_2)|\mathbf{v}|, \\
  |(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{f})'(x)|
  &\leq \left(\frac{M_0}{h} + h M_2\right)|\mathbf{v}|
\end{align*}
holds for any $\mathbf{v}$ and $h > 0$.
In particular, we take
\[
  \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{f}'(y)
\]
and
\[
  h = \sqrt{\frac{M_0}{M_2}}
\]
to get
\[
  |\mathbf{f}'(x) \cdot \mathbf{f}'(y)|
  \leq 2 \sqrt{M_0 M_2} |\mathbf{f}'(y)|
  \leq 2 M_1 \sqrt{M_0 M_2}.
\]
Note that $x$ and $y$ are arbitrary (in $(a,+\infty)$).
In particular, we take $x = y$ to get
\[
  |\mathbf{f}'(x)|^2 \leq 2 M_1 \sqrt{M_0 M_2}.
\]
Thus $2 M_1 \sqrt{M_0 M_2}$ is an upper bound of $|\mathbf{f}'(x)|^2$ for all $x \in (a,+\infty)$.
Hence
\[
  M_1^2 \leq 2 M_1 \sqrt{M_0 M_2}
\]
or
\[
  M_1^2 \leq 4 M_0 M_2.
\]
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\

\textbf{Supplement (Landau-Kolmogorov inequality on the real line).}
\emph{Suppose $f$ is a twice-differentiable real function on $(-\infty,+\infty)$,
and $M_0$, $M_1$, $M_2$ are the least upper bounds of
$|f(x)|$, $|f'(x)|$, $|f''(x)|$, respectively, on $(-\infty,+\infty)$.
Prove that
\[
  M_1^2 \leq 2 M_0 M_2.
\]}

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
Similar to (1) in Landau-Kolmogorov inequality on the half-line,
we suppose that $0 < M_0 < +\infty$ and $0 < M_2 < +\infty$.

\item[(2)]
Similar to (2) in Landau-Kolmogorov inequality on the half-line.
Given $x \in \mathbb{R}^1$ and $h>0$.
By Taylor's theorem (Theorem 5.15):
\begin{align*}
  f(x+2h) &= f(x) + 2h f'(x) + 2 h^2 f''(\xi_1) \tag{I} \\
  f(x-2h) &= f(x) - 2h f'(x) + 2 h^2 f''(\xi_2) \tag{II}
\end{align*}
for some $\xi_1 \in (x,x+2h)$ and $\xi_2 \in (x,x-2h)$.
So (I) subtracts (II):
\[
  f(x+2h)-f(x-2h) = 4h f'(x) + 2 h^2 f''(\xi_1) - 2 h^2 f''(\xi_2).
\]
Thus
\begin{align*}
  4h|f'(x)|
  &\leq |f(x+2h)| + |f(x-2h)| + 2 h^2 |f''(\xi_1)| + 2 h^2 |f''(\xi_2)| \\
  &\leq 2 M_0 + 4 h^2 M_2, \\
  |f'(x)|
  &\leq \frac{M_0}{2h} + h M_2
\end{align*}
holds for all $h > 0$.
In particular, take
\[
  h = \sqrt{\frac{M_0}{2M_2}}
\]
to get
\[
  |f'(x)| \leq \sqrt{2 M_0 M_2}.
\]
Thus $\sqrt{2 M_0 M_2}$ is an upper bound of $|f'(x)|$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^1$.
Hence
\[
  M_1 \leq \sqrt{2 M_0 M_2}
\]
or
\[
  M_1^2 \leq 2 M_0 M_2.
\]
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Note.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
Write
\[
  M_1 \leq \sqrt{2} M_0^{\frac{1}{2}} M_2^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\]
$\sqrt{2}$ is called the Landau-Kolmogorov constant,
which is the best possible.

\item[(2)]
In general,
suppose $f$ is a $n$th differentiable real function on $\mathbb{R}^1$,
and $M_0$, $M_k$, $M_n$ are the least upper bounds of
$\abs{ f(x) }$, $\abs{ f^{(k)}(x) }$, $\abs{ f^{(n)}(x) }$, respectively, on $\mathbb{R}^1$
where $1 \leq k < n$.
Then
\[
  M_k \leq C(n,k) M_0^{1 - \frac{k}{n}} M_n^{\frac{k}{n}}.
\] \\

Prove that $f'(x) \to 0$ as $x \to \infty$.
(Hint: Let $a \to \infty$ in Exercise 5.15.)} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
Write $|f''| \leq M$ for some real $M$ since $f''$ is bounded on $(0,\infty)$.

\item[(2)]
Given any $a > 0$.
As in Exercise 5.15, define $M_0, M_1, M_2$ are the least upper bounds of
$|f(x)|$, $|f'(x)|$, $|f''(x)|$ on $(a,\infty)$.
Note that $M_2 \leq M$ for any $a > 0$ (by (1)).
So that
\[
  M_1^2 \leq 4 M_0 M_2 \leq 4M M_0
\]
for any $a > 0$.

\item[(3)]
By assumption, $M_0 \to 0$ as $a \to \infty$.
(So given any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a real $A$ such that
\[
  0 \leq M_0 < \frac{\varepsilon}{4M + 1}
\]
whenever $a \geq A$.
Hence
\[
  M_1^2 \leq 4M M_0 \leq 4M \cdot \frac{\varepsilon}{4M + 1} < \varepsilon.

whenever $a \geq A$.)
Therefore $M_1^2 \to 0$ as $a \to \infty$,

\emph{Suppose $f$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$, $f(a) = 0$,

Prove that $f(x)=0$ for all $x \in [a,b]$.

For any such $x$,
\[
  |f(x)| \leq M_1(x_0-a) \leq A(x_0-a) M_0.
\]
Hence $M_0 = 0$ if $A(x_0-a) < 1$.
That is, $f = 0$ on $[a,x_0]$.
Proceed.)} \\

\emph{Proof (Hint).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
If $A = 0$, then $f'(x) = 0$ or $f(x)$ is constant on $[a,b]$ (Theorem 5.11(b)).
Since $f(a) = 0$, $f(x) = 0$ on $[a,b]$.

\item[(2)]
Suppose that $A > 0$.
Fix $x_0 \in [a,b]$, let
\[
  M_0 = \sup{|f(x)|}, \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: M_1 = \sup{|f'(x)|}
\]
for $a \leq x \leq x_0$.
Since $|f'(x)| \leq A|f(x)|$ on $[a,b]$,
\[
  |f'(x)| \leq A|f(x)| \leq A M_0.
\]
Since $A M_0$ is an upper bound for $|f'(x)|$,
\[
  M_1 \leq A M_0.
\]

\item[(3)]
Given any $x \in [a,x_0]$.
Since $f$ is differentiable on $[a,x_0] \subseteq [a,b]$,
by the mean value theorem (Theorem 5.10), there is $\xi \in (a,x)$
such that
\[
  f(x) - f(a) = f'(\xi)(x - a).
\]
Note that $f(a) = 0$ by assumption.
So that
\begin{align*}
  |f(x)|
  &= |f'(\xi)|(x - a) \\
  &\leq M_1 (x - a)
    &(\text{Definition of $M_1$}) \\
  &\leq A M_0 (x - a)
    &((2)) \\
  &\leq A M_0 (x_0 - a).
    &(x \in [a,x_0])
\end{align*}
Since $A M_0 (x_0 - a)$ is an upper bound for $|f(x)|$,
\[
  M_0 \leq A M_0 (x_0 - a).
\]
Take
\[
  x_0 = \min \left\{ \frac{1}{2A} + a, b \right\}
\]
so that $M_0 \leq A M_0 (x_0 - a) \leq \frac{M_0}{2}$.
$M_0 = 0$ or $f(x) = 0$ on $[a,x_0]$.

\item[(4)]
Take a partition
\[
  P = \{ a = x_{-1}, x_0, \ldots, x_n = b \}
\]
of $[a,b]$ such that each subinterval $[x_{i-1},x_i]$ satisfying
$\Delta x_i = x_i - x_{i-1} < \frac{1}{2A}$.
By (3), $f(x) = 0$ on $[x_{-1},x_0]$.
Apply the same argument in (3), $f(x) = 0$ on $[x_0,x_1]$.
Continue this process, $f(x) = 0$ on each subinterval and thus on the whole interval $[a,b]$.

It holds for vector-valued functions too:

\emph{Suppose $\mathbf{f}$ is a vector-valued differentiable function on $[a,b]$, $f(a) = 0$,

Find all other solutions.} \\



\emph{Proof (Hint).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
Suppose $f_1$ and $f_2$ are two solutions of that problem.
Define $f = f_1 - f_2$.
$f$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$, $f(a) = f_1(a) - f_2(a) = c - c = 0$.
And
\begin{align*}
  |f'(x)|
  &= |f_1'(x) - f_2'(x)| \\
  &= \abs{ \phi(x,f_1(x)) - \phi(x,f_2(x)) } \\
  &\leq A | f_1(x) - f_2(x) |
\end{align*}
on $[a,b]$.
By Exercise 5.26, $f(x) = 0$ on $[a,b]$, or $f_1(x) = f_2(x)$ on $[a,b]$.

\item[(2)]
\emph{The initial-value problem
\[
  y' = y^{\frac{1}{2}}, \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: y(0) = 0,
\]
which has two solutions: $f(x) = 0$ and $f(x) = \frac{x^2}{4}$.
Find all other solutions.} \\

  \emph{Note.}
  It does not exist a real $A$ such that $|\phi(x,y_2) - \phi(x,y_1)| \leq A|y_2 - y_1|$
  in this initial-value problem.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  Clearly, $f(x) = 0$ and $f(x) = \frac{x^2}{4}$ are two solutions for the initial-value problem.

  \item[(b)]
  Suppose $f(x) \neq 0$ on $[0,\infty)$.
  Since $f'(x) = f(x)^{\frac{1}{2}}$, $f(x) \geq 0$.
  Since $f(x)$ is continuous (Theorem 5.2), the set
  \[
    E = \{ x \in [0, \infty) : f(x) > 0 \}
  \]
  is open in $\mathbb{R}^1$ (Theorem 4.8).
  By Exercise 2.29
  we write $E$ as the union of an at most countable collection of disjoint segments,
  say
  \[
    E = \bigcup_{(a_i,b_i) \subseteq [0, \infty)} (a_i,b_i)
  \]
  where all $(a_i,b_i)$ segments are disjoint.
  Note that $E$ is nonempty.

  \item[(c)]
  For any segment $(a_i,b_i)$,
  define $g(x) = f(x)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ on $(a_i,b_i)$.
  (Clearly, $g(a_i) = f(a_i) = 0$ by the definition of $E$.)
  Thus
  \[
    g'(x) = \frac{1}{2} f(x)^{-\frac{1}{2}} f'(x) = \frac{1}{2}.
  \]
  Hence
  \[
    g(x) = \frac{1}{2} x + c
  \]
  for some constant $c \in \mathbb{R}^1$.
  So
  \[
    f(x) = g(x)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{2} x + c \right)^2.
  \]
  $f(a_i) = 0$ implies that $c = -\frac{a_i}{2}$.
  Hence
  \[
    f(x) = \frac{1}{4}(x - a_i)^2
  \]
  on $(a_i,b_i)$.

  \item[(d)]
  By (c), if $b_i < 0$ is defined as a real number,
  then $f(b_i) = 0$ by definition of $E$.
  Note that
  \[
    \lim_{x \to b_i-} f(x) = \frac{1}{4}(b_i - a_i)^2 > 0,
  \]
  which is absurd.
  Hence $b_i = \infty$ and thus $E$ is of the form
  \[
    E = (a,\infty) \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: (a \geq 0).
  \]
  Therefore,
  \begin{equation*}
  f(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      0                    & (0 \leq x \leq a), \\
      \frac{1}{4}(x - a)^2 & (x > a \geq 0).
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Exercise 5.28.}
\emph{Formulate and prove an analogous uniqueness theorem for
systems of differential equations of the form
\[
  y'_j = \phi_j(x, y_1, \ldots, y_k), \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:
  y_j(a) = c_j \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:
  (j = 1, \ldots, k)

Note that this can be rewritten in the form
\[
  \mathbf{y}' = \bm{\phi}(x,y), \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:
  \mathbf{y}(a) = \mathbf{c}
\]
where $\mathbf{y} = (y_1, ..., y_k)$ ranges over a $k$-cell,
$\bm{\phi}$ is the mapping of a $(k+1)$-cell into the Euclidean $k$-space
whose components are the function $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_k$,
and $\mathbf{c}$ is the vector $(c_1, \ldots, c_k)$.
Use Exercise 5.26, for vector-valued functions.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
\emph{A \textbf{solution} of the initial-value problem
\[
  \mathbf{y}' = \bm{\phi}(x,y), \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:
  \mathbf{y}(a) = \mathbf{c}
\]
is, by definition, a differentiable function $\mathbf{f}$ on $[a,b]$
such that $\mathbf{f}(a) = \mathbf{c}$, and
\[
  \mathbf{f}'(x) = \bm{\phi}(x,\mathbf{f}(x)) \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: (a \leq x \leq b).
\]
Then this problem has at most one solution if there is a constant $A$ such that
\[
  \abs{ \bm{\phi}(x,\mathbf{y}_2) - \bm{\phi}(x,\mathbf{y}_1) }
  \leq A \abs{ \mathbf{y}_2 - \mathbf{y}_1 }
\]
whenever $(x,\mathbf{y}_1) \in R$ and $(x,\mathbf{y}_2) \in R$
where $R$ is a $(k+1)$-cell defined by
\[
  R = [a,b] \times [\alpha_1,\beta_1] \times \cdots \times [\alpha_k,\beta_k].
\]}
\item[(2)]
Similar to Exercise 5.27,
Suppose $\mathbf{f}_1$ and $\mathbf{f}_2$ are two solutions of that problem.
Define $\mathbf{f} = \mathbf{f}_1 - \mathbf{f}_2$.
$\mathbf{f}$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$,
$\mathbf{f}(a) = \mathbf{f}_1(a) - \mathbf{f}_2(a) = \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{c} = 0$.
And
\begin{align*}
  |\mathbf{f}'(x)|
  &= |\mathbf{f}_1'(x) - \mathbf{f}_2'(x)| \\
  &= \abs{ \bm{\phi}(x,\mathbf{f}_1(x)) - \bm{\phi}(x,\mathbf{f}_2(x)) } \\
  &\leq A | \mathbf{f}_1(x) - \mathbf{f}_2(x) |
\end{align*}
on $[a,b]$.
By Note in Exercise 5.26,
$\mathbf{f}(x) = 0$ on $[a,b]$, or $\mathbf{f}_1(x) = \mathbf{f}_2(x)$ on $[a,b]$.
