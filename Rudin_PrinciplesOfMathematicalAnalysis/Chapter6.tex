\textbf{Supplement.} Another definition of Riemann-Stieltjes integral.
\emph{(Exercise 7.3, 7.4 of the book
T. M. Apostol, Mathematical Analysis, Second Edition.)
Let $P$ be a partition of $[a, b]$.
The norm of a partition $P$ is the length of the largest subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$
of $P$ and is denoted by $\Vert P \Vert$.} \\

\emph{We say $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$
if there exists $A \in \mathbb{R}$ having the property that
for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that
for any partition $P$ of $[a, b]$ with norm $\Vert P \Vert < \delta$
and for any choice of $t_i \in [x_{i-1}, x_i]$,
we have $|\sum_{i = 1}^{n} f(t_i) \Delta \alpha_i - A| < \varepsilon$.} \\\\

\textbf{Claim.}
\emph{$f \in \mathscr{R}$ in the sense of Definition 6.2
implies that
$f \in \mathscr{R}$ in the sense of this another definition.} \\

\emph{Proof of Claim.}
Let $A = \int f dx$, $M > 0$ be one upper bound of $|f|$ on $[a, b]$.
Given $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a partition
$P_0 = \{a = x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{N-1}, x_N = b \}$
such that
$U(P_0, f) \leq A + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$.
Let $\delta = \frac{\varepsilon}{2MN} > 0$.
Then for any partition $P$ with norm $\Vert P \Vert < \delta$, write
$$U(P, f) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} M_i \Delta x_i = S_1 + S_2,$$
where
$S_1$ is the sum of terms arising from those subintervals of $P$ containing no point of $P_0$,
$S_2$ is the sum of the remaining terms.
Then
\begin{align*}
S_1 &\leq U(P_0, f) < A + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, \\
S_2 &\leq NM \Vert P \Vert < NM \delta < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}.
\end{align*}
Therefore, $U(P, f) < A + \varepsilon$.
Similarly, $L(P, f) > A - \varepsilon$ whenever $\Vert P \Vert < \delta'$.
Hence, $|\sum_{i = 1}^{n} f(t_i) \Delta x_i - A| < \varepsilon$
whenever $\Vert P \Vert < \min\{\delta, \delta'\}$.
(Copy Apostol's hint and ensure $M > 0$. $M$ in Apostol's hint might be zero if $f = 0$.)
$\Box$ \\



This supplement will be used in computing
$\int_0^{\infty} (\frac{\sin x}{x})^2 dx = \frac{\pi}{2}$ in Exercise 8.12. \\\\

\textbf{Exercise 6.1.}
\emph{Suppose $\alpha$ increases on $[a, b]$, $a \leq â‰¤ x_0 \leq b$,
$\alpha$ is continuous at $x_0$, $f(x_0) = 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ if $x \neq x_0$.
Prove that $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ and that $\int f d \alpha = 0$.} \\

Given any partition $P = \{a = p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}, p_n = b \}$,
where $a = p_0 \leq p_1 \leq \cdots \leq p_{n-1} \leq p_n = b$.
We might compute $L(P, f, \alpha)$ and $U(P, f, \alpha)$ by using $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ argument
since we are hinted by the condition that $\alpha$ is continuous.
A function which is continuous at $x_0$ has a nice property near $x_0$
and this property would help us estimate $U(P, f, \alpha)$ near $x_0$.
On the contrary, if both $f$ and $\alpha$ are discontinuous at $x_0$,
it might be $f \not\in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$.
Besides, if $f$ has too many points of discontinuity
($f(x) = 0$ if $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $f(x) = 1$ otherwise, for example),
then $f$ might not be Riemann-integrable on $[0, 1]$. \\\\



\textbf{Claim 1.}
\emph{$L(P, f, \alpha) = 0$.} \\

\emph{Proof of Claim 1.}
$m_i = 0$ since $\inf f(x) = 0$ on any subinterval of $[a, b]$.
So $L(P, f, \alpha) = \sum m_i \Delta \alpha_i = 0$.
Here we don't need the condition that $\alpha$ is continuous at $x_0$.
$\Box$ \\\\



\textbf{Claim 2.}
\emph{For any $\varepsilon > 0$,
there exists a partition $P$ such that $U(P, f, \alpha) < \varepsilon$.} \\

\emph{Proof of Claim 2.}
Say $x_0 \in [p_{i_0 - 1}, p_{i_0}]$ for some $i_0$.
Then
\begin{equation*}
  M_i = \sup_{p_{i - 1} \leq x \leq p_i} f(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      0 & \text{ if $i \neq i_0$}, \\
      1 & \text{ if $i = i_0$}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
So
$$U(P, f, \alpha) = \sum M_i \Delta \alpha_i = \Delta \alpha_{i_0}.$$
It is not true for any arbitrary $\alpha$. (For example, $\alpha$ has a jump on $x = x_0$.)
In fact, Exercise 6.3 shows this.
Luckily, $\alpha$ is continuous at $x_0$. So for $\varepsilon > 0$,
there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|\alpha(x) - \alpha(x_0)| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$
whenever $|x - x_0| < \delta$ (and $x \in [a, b]$).
Now we pick a nice partition
$$P = \{ a, x_0 - \delta_1, x_0 + \delta_2, b \},$$
where $\delta_1 = \min\{\delta, x_0 - a\} \geq 0$
and $\delta_2 = \min\{\delta, b - x_0\} \geq 0$.
(It is a trick about resizing ``$\delta$''
to avoid considering the edge cases $x_0 = a$ or $x_0 = b$ or $a = b$.)
Then $x_0 \in [x_0 - \delta_1, x_0 + \delta_2]$
and $\Delta \alpha$ on $[x_0 - \delta_1, x_0 + \delta_2]$ is
\begin{align*}
\alpha(x_0 + \delta_2) - \alpha(x_0 - \delta_1)
&= (\alpha(x_0 + \delta_2) - \alpha(x_0)) + (\alpha(x_0) - \alpha(x_0 - \delta_1)) \\
&< \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} = \varepsilon.
\end{align*}
Therefore, $U(P, f, \alpha) < \varepsilon$.
$\Box$ \\\\



\emph{Proof (Definition 6.2).}
By Claim 1 and 2 and notice that $U(P, f, \alpha) \geq 0$ for any partition $P$,
\begin{align*}
\upint_a^b f d\alpha &= \inf U(P, f, \alpha) = 0, \\
\lowint_a^b f d\alpha &= \sup L(P, f, \alpha) = 0,
\end{align*}
the inf and sup again being taken over all partitions.
Hence $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ and that $\int f d \alpha = 0$ by Definition 6.2.
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Proof (Theorem 6.5).}
By Claim 1 and 2,
$$0 \leq U(P, f, \alpha) - L(P, f, \alpha) < \varepsilon.$$
Hence $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ by Theorem 6.5.
Furthermore,
$$\int f d \alpha = \lowint_a^b f d\alpha = \sup L(P, f, \alpha) = 0.$$
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Proof (Theorem 6.10).}
$f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ by Theorem 6.10.
Thus, by Claim 1
$$\int f d \alpha = \lowint_a^b f d\alpha = \sup L(P, f, \alpha) = 0.$$
$\Box$ \\\\

\textbf{Exercise 6.2.}
\emph{Suppose $f \geq 0$,
$f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, and $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = 0$.
Prove that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \in [a,b]$.
(Compare with Exercise 6.1.)} \\

For one application, see Exercise 7.20. \\

\emph{Proof.}
(Reductio ad absurdum)
If there were $p \in [a,b]$ such that $f(p) > 0$.
Since $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, given $\varepsilon = \frac{1}{64}f(p) > 0$
there exists $\delta > 0$
such that
\[
  |f(x) - f(p)| \leq \frac{1}{64}f(p) \text{ whenever } |x-p| \leq \delta, x \in [a,b].
\]
Hence
\[
  f(x) \geq \frac{63}{64}f(p)
\]
whenever $x \in E = [\max\{a,p-\delta\}, \min\{b,p+\delta\}] \subseteq [a,b]$.
Note that the length of $E$ is $|E| > 0$.
So
\[
  0
  = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx
  \geq \int_{E} f(x) dx
  \geq \int_{E} \frac{63}{64}f(p) dx
  = \frac{63}{64}f(p)|E| > 0,
\]
which is absurd.
$\Box$ \\

Then $\int f = 0$ implies $f = 0$ a.e.} \\\\

\textbf{Exercise 6.4.}
\emph{If
\begin{equation*}
  f(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      0 & \text{ for all irrational $x$}, \\
      1 & \text{ for all rational $x$},
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
prove that $f \not\in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a,b]$ for any $a < b$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
Given any partition
\[
  P = \{a = p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}, p_n = b \}
\]
of $[a,b]$ where $a = p_0 \leq p_1 \leq \cdots \leq p_{n-1} \leq p_n = b$.
Since $a < b$, we might assume that $a = p_0 < p_1 < \cdots < p_{n-1} < p_n = b$
by removing duplicated points.
Since $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q}$ are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, we have
\begin{align*}
  M_i &= \sup_{p_{i-1} \leq x \leq p_i} f(x) = 1, \\
  m_i &= \inf_{p_{i-1} \leq x \leq p_i} f(x) = 0, \\
  U(P,f) &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} M_i \Delta x_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \Delta x_i = b - a, \\
  L(P,f) &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i \Delta x_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 0 = 0.
\end{align*}
Since $P$ is arbitrary,
\begin{align*}
  \upint_a^b f dx &= \inf U(P,f) = b-a > 0, \\
  \lowint_a^b f dx &= \sup L(P,f) = 0.
\end{align*}
Hence $f \not\in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a,b]$ for any $a < b$.
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Note.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  $f \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a,b]$ iff $a = b$.

\item[(2)]
  (Problem 4.1 in \emph{H. L. Royden, Real Analysis, 3rd edition}.)
  \emph{Construct a sequence $\{f_n\}$ of nonnegative,
  Riemann integrable functions such that $f_n$ increases monotonically to $f$.
  What does this imply about changing the order of integration and the limiting process?}
  (Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, write
  \[
    \mathbb{Q} = \{ r_1, r_2, \ldots \}.
  \]
  Define
  \begin{equation*}
    f_n(x) =
      \begin{cases}
        0 & \text{ if $x \not\in \{ r_1, \ldots, r_n \}$ }, \\
        1 & \text{ if $x \in \{ r_1, \ldots, r_n \}$ }.
      \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  By construction, $f_n$ increases monotonically to $f$ pointwise.
  Note that $f_n \to f$ not uniformly.
  Also, $\int_{a}^{b} f_n(x) dx = 0$ by using the same argument in Theorem 6.10.
  Therefore,
  $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{a}^{b} f_n(x) dx = 0$
  but $\int_{a}^{b} \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) dx = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$
  does not exist.) \\

\textbf{Exercise 6.5.}
\emph{Suppose $f$ is a bounded real function on $[a,b]$,
and $f^2 \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a,b]$.
Does it follow that $f \in \mathscr{R}$?
Does the answer change if we assume that $f^3 \in \mathscr{R}$?} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
\emph{Show that $f^2 \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a,b]$ does not imply that
$f \in \mathscr{R}$ (unless $f \geq 0$ on $[a,b]$).}
Similar to Exercise 6.4,
define
\begin{equation*}
  f(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      -1 & \text{ for all irrational $x$}, \\
      1 & \text{ for all rational $x$}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
$f^2 = 1 \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a,b]$ but
$f \not\in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a,b]$ for any $a < b$.
(The proof for the ``unless'' part is similar to (2).)

\item[(2)]
\emph{Show that $f^3 \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[a,b]$ implies that
$f \in \mathscr{R}$.}
Let $\phi(x) = x^{\frac{1}{3}}$ on $\mathbb{R}$.
By Theorem 6.11, $f(x) = \phi(f(x)^3) \in \mathscr{R}$.

$\Box$ \\

\emph{Note.}
(Lebesgue integral)
\emph{Suppose that $f^2$ is Lebesgue integrable.
Does it follow that $f$ is Lebesgue integrable?
Does the answer change if we assume that $f^3$ is Lebesgue integrable?}
Both answers are no. \\\\

\textbf{Exercise 6.7.}
\emph{Suppose $f$ is a real function on $(0,1]$ and $f \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[c,1]$
for every $c > 0$.
Define
\[
  \int_{0}^{1}f(x)dx = \lim_{c \to 0} \int_{c}^{1}f(x)dx
\]
if this limit exists (and is finite).}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  \emph{If $f \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[0,1]$,
  show that this definition of the integral agrees with the old one.}

  \item[(b)]
  \emph{Construct a function such that the above limit exists,
  although it fails to exist with $|f|$ in place of $f$.} \\
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Since $f \in \mathscr{R}$ on $[0,1]$, $f$ is bounded or
  $|f| \leq M$ for some real $M$.

\item[(2)]
For any $0 < c < 1$,
we have
\begin{align*}
  \abs{ \int_{0}^{1} f(x)dx - \int_{c}^{1} f(x)dx }
  &= \abs{ \int_{0}^{c} f(x)dx }
    &\text{(Theorem 6.12(c))}\\
  &\leq Mc.
    &\text{(Theorem 6.12(d))}
\end{align*}

\item[(3)]
Given any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta = \frac{\varepsilon}{M+1} > 0$
such that
\[
  \abs{ \int_{0}^{c} f(x)dx - \int_{0}^{1} f(x)dx }
  \leq Mc
  < M \delta
  = M \cdot \frac{\varepsilon}{M+1}
  < \varepsilon
\]
whenever $0 < c < \delta$.
Hence $\lim_{c \to 0} \int_{0}^{c} f(x)dx = \int_{0}^{1} f(x)dx$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b)(Construct by nonabsolutely convergent series).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
Given any nonabsolutely (conditionally) convergent series $\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k$
(take $\sum \frac{(-1)^n}{n}$ for example and then see Remark 3.46),
we define $f$ on $(0,1]$ by
\[
  f(x) = 2^{n} a_n
\]
if $\frac{1}{2^{n}} < x \leq \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$ as $n = 1,2,\ldots$.

\item[(2)]
By construction,
\[
  \int_{\frac{1}{2^{n}}}^{\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}} f(x) dx
  = \left( \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} - \frac{1}{2^{n}}\right) 2^n a_n = a_n.
\]
and thus
\[
  \int_{\frac{1}{2^{n}}}^{1} f(x) dx
  = \int_{\frac{1}{2^{n}}}^{\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}} f(x) dx
    + \cdots
    + \int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{1} f(x) dx
  = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k.
\]

\item[(3)]
Given any $\varepsilon > 0$.
Since $\sum a_n$ is convergent, there exists a common integer $N$
such that
\[
  |a_n| \leq \frac{\varepsilon}{89}
\]
and
\[
  \abs{ \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k - A } \leq \frac{\varepsilon}{64}
\]
for some real $A$ whenever $n \geq N$
(Definition 3.21 and Theorem 3.23).
Therefore, for any $0 < c \leq \frac{1}{2^N}$,
say $\frac{1}{2^{n+1}} < c \leq \frac{1}{2^n} \leq \frac{1}{2^N}$ for some $n \geq N$,
we have
\begin{align*}
  \abs{ \int_{c}^{1} f(x) dx - A }
  &= \abs{ \int_{c}^{\frac{1}{2^{n}}} f(x) dx
    + \int_{\frac{1}{2^{n}}}^{1} f(x) dx
    - A } \\
  &\leq \abs{ \left( \frac{1}{2^{n}} - c \right) 2^{n+1} a_{n+1} }
    + \abs{ \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k - A } \\
  &\leq \abs{ a_{n+1} } + \abs{ \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k - A } \\
  &\leq \frac{\varepsilon}{89} + \frac{\varepsilon}{64} \\
  &\leq \varepsilon.
\end{align*}
Hence, $\lim_{c \to 0} \int_{c}^{1} f(x) dx = A$ exists.

\item[(4)]
Since
\[
  \int_{\frac{1}{2^{n}}}^{1} |f(x)| dx
  = \int_{\frac{1}{2^{n}}}^{\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}} |f(x)| dx
    + \cdots
    + \int_{\frac{1}{2}}^{1} |f(x)| dx
  = \sum_{k=1}^{n} |a_k| \to \infty
\]
as $n \to \infty$,
$\lim_{c \to 0} \int_{c}^{1}f(x)dx$ does not exist.

  \]
  This is \textbf{H\"older's inequality}.
  When $p=q=2$ it is usually called the Schwarz inequality.
  (Note that Theorem 1.35 is a very special case of this.)}

  \item[(d)]
  \emph{Show that H\"older's inequality is also true for the ``improper'' integrals
  described in Exercise 6.7 and 6.8.} \\
\end{enumerate}



\emph{Proof of (a)(Young's inequality).}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  $u = 0$ or $v = 0$ is nothing to do.
  For $u > 0$ and $v > 0$, we give some different proofs.

  \item[(2)]
  First proof.
  \begin{align*}
    uv
    &= \exp(\log(uv)) \\
    &= \exp(\frac{1}{p}\log(u^p) + \frac{1}{q}\log(v^q)) \\
    &\leq \frac{1}{p} \exp(\log(u^p)) + \frac{1}{q}\exp(\log(v^q))
      &\text{(Convexity of $\exp(x)$)} \\
    &= \frac{u^p}{p} + \frac{v^q}{q}.
  \end{align*}
  Here the convexity of $\exp(x)$ can be derived
  by the fact that $(\exp(x))'' > 0$ and Exercise 5.14.
  The fact that the equality holds if and only if $u^p = v^q$
  is derived from the strictly convexity of $\exp(x)$ additionally.
  (For the details about the exponential and logarithmic functions,
  might see Chapter 8.)

  \item[(3)]
  Second proof.
  \begin{align*}
    \log(\frac{u^p}{p} + \frac{v^q}{q})
    &\geq \frac{1}{p} \log(u^p) + \frac{1}{q}\log(v^q)
      &\text{(Concavity of $\log(x)$)} \\
    &= \log(u) + \log(v) \\
    &= \log(uv).
  \end{align*}
  Since $\log(x)$ increases monotonically ($(\log(x))' = \frac{1}{x} > 0$ if $x > 0$),
  $\frac{u^p}{p} + \frac{v^q}{q} \geq uv$
  (or take the exponential function to get the same conclusion).
  Here the concavity of $\log(x)$ can be derived
  by the fact that $(\log(x))'' < 0$ and a statement that
  $f''(x) \leq 0$ if and only if $f$ is concave.
  The fact that the equality holds if and only if $u^p = v^q$
  is derived from the strictly concavity of $\log(x)$ additionally.
  (The proof is analogous to Exercise 5.14.)

  \item[(4)]
  Third proof.
  \emph{Suppose that $f:[0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$ is a strictly increasing continuous function
  such that $f(0) = 0$ and $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \infty$.
  Then
  \[
    uv \leq \int_{0}^{u} f(x)dx + \int_{0}^{v} f^{-1}(x)dx
  \]
  for every $u,v \geq 0$, and equality occurs if and only if $v = f(u)$.}
  Define
  \[
    F(x) = -xf(x) + \int_{0}^{x} f(t)dt + \int_{0}^{f(x)} f^{-1}(t)dt.
  \]
  By Theorem 6.20 (the fundamental theorem of calculus) and Theorem 5.5 (chain rule),
  \[
    F'(x) = -(f(x) + xf'(x))+ f(x) + f'(x) f^{-1}(f(x)) = 0.
  \]
  Hence $F(x)$ is a constant on $(0,u)$ (Theorem 5.11(b)).
  Note that $F(x)$ is continuous on $[0,u]$ and $F(0) = 0$,
  so $F(x) = 0$ on $[0,u]$
  or
  \[
    \int_{0}^{x} f(t)dt + \int_{0}^{f(x)} f^{-1}(t)dt = xf(x).
  \]
  Take $x = u$ to get
  \[
    \int_{0}^{u} f(x)dx + \int_{0}^{f(u)} f^{-1}(x)dx = uf(u).
  \]
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    &\int_{0}^{u} f(x)dx + \int_{0}^{v} f^{-1}(x)dx - uv \\
    =&
    \int_{0}^{u} f(x)dx + \int_{0}^{f(u)} f^{-1}(x)dx + \int_{f(u)}^{v} f^{-1}(x)dx - uv \\
    =&
    uf(u) + \int_{f(u)}^{v} f^{-1}(x)dx - uv \\
    =&
    \int_{f(u)}^{v} [ f^{-1}(x)-f^{-1}(f(u)) ] dx \\
    \geq&
    0.
  \end{align*}
  The last inequality holds since $f$ is strictly increasing
  and thus $f^{-1}$ is strictly increasing too.
  Besides, the equality holds if and only if $f(u) = v$.
  Now the conclusion holds by taking $f(x) = x^{p-1}$ in
  \[
    uv \leq \int_{0}^{u} f(x)dx + \int_{0}^{v} f^{-1}(x)dx
  \]
  and the equality holds if and only if $u^p = v^q$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (b).}
Every integral is well-defined (Theorem 6.11 and Theorem 6.13(a)).
Let $u = f \geq 0$ and $v = g \geq 0$ in (a).
Integrate both sides of the inequality
\[
  fg \leq \frac{f^p}{p} + \frac{g^q}{q}
\]
to get
\begin{align*}
  \int_{a}^{b} fg d\alpha
  &\leq \int_{a}^{b} \left( \frac{f^p}{p} + \frac{g^q}{q} \right) d\alpha
    &\text{(Theorem 6.12(b))} \\
  &= \int_{a}^{b} \frac{f^p}{p} d\alpha + \int_{a}^{b} \frac{g^q}{q} d\alpha
    &\text{(Theorem 6.12(a))} \\
  &= \frac{1}{p} \int_{a}^{b} f^p d\alpha + \frac{1}{q} \int_{a}^{b} g^q d\alpha
    &\text{(Theorem 6.12(a))} \\
  &= \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q}
    &\text{(Assumption)} \\
  &= 1.
\end{align*}
The equality holds if $f^p = g^q$.
Note that the equality does not hold only if $f^p = g^q$.
(Consider $\alpha$ is constant on some subinterval $[c,d] \subsetneq [a,b]$.)
Luckily, it is true for the additional assumption that
$\alpha(x) = x$ and $f, g$ are continuous on $[a,b]$.
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (c).}
There are three possible cases.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  The case $\left\{ \int_{a}^{b} |f|^p d\alpha \right\}^{\frac{1}{p}} = 0$.
  So $\int_{a}^{b} |f|^p d\alpha = 0$.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that $\int_{a}^{b} |f| d\alpha = 0$ if $\int_{a}^{b} |f|^p d\alpha = 0$.}
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  If $\int_{a}^{b} |f| d\alpha = A > 0$, then given $\varepsilon = \frac{A}{2} > 0$,
  there exists a partition $P_0 = \{a=x_0 \leq \cdots \leq x_n = b \}$ such that
  \[
    \sum_{i=0}^{n} m_i \Delta \alpha_i > \frac{A}{2},
  \]
  where $m_i = \inf_{x \in [x_{i-1},x_i]} |f|$ and
  $\Delta \alpha_i = \alpha(x_i) - \alpha(x_{i-1})$.
  By the pigeonhole principle,
  there exists $1 \leq i_0 \leq n$
  such that
  \[
    L(P_0,|f|,\alpha) = m_{i_0} \Delta \alpha_{i_0} > \frac{A}{2n} > 0.
  \]
  Especially, $m_{i_0} > 0$ and $\Delta \alpha_{i_0} > 0$.
  Now we consider $L(P,|f|^p,\alpha)$.
  Hence
  \[
    L(P_0,|f|^p,\alpha)
  = \sum_{i=0}^{n} m_i^p \Delta \alpha_i
  \geq m_{i_0}^p \Delta \alpha_{i_0} > 0,
  \]
  or
  \[
    \lowint_{a}^{b}|f|d\alpha = \sup L(P,f,\alpha) \geq m_{i_0}^p \Delta \alpha_{i_0} > 0,
  \]
  which is absurd.

  \item[(b)]
  \emph{Show that $\int_{a}^{b} |fg| d\alpha = 0$ if $\int_{a}^{b} |f| d\alpha = 0$.}
  Since $g \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$, $|g|$ is bounded by some real $M$ on $[a,b]$,
  that is, $|g(x)| \leq M$.
  Hence
  \[
    0
  \leq \int_{a}^{b} |fg| d\alpha
  \leq \int_{a}^{b} M|f| d\alpha
  = M \int_{a}^{b}|f| d\alpha
  = 0.
  \]
  Therefore $\int_{a}^{b} |fg| d\alpha = 0$.
  \end{enumerate}
  By (a)(b), $\int_{a}^{b} |fg| d\alpha = 0$
  and thus H\"older's inequality holds for this case.

\item[(2)]
  The case $\left\{ \int_{a}^{b} |g|^q d\alpha \right\}^{\frac{1}{q}} = 0$.
  Similar to (1).

\item[(3)]
  If both
  $\left\{ \int_{a}^{b} |f|^p d\alpha \right\}^{\frac{1}{p}} > 0$
  and
  $\left\{ \int_{a}^{b} |g|^q d\alpha \right\}^{\frac{1}{q}} > 0$,
  then we apply (b)
  to
  \[
    F(x) = \frac{|f(x)|}{\left\{ \int_{a}^{b} |f(x)|^p d\alpha \right\}^{\frac{1}{p}}}
    \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:
    \text{ and }
    \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:
    G(x) = \frac{|g(x)|}{\left\{ \int_{a}^{b} |g(x)|^q d\alpha \right\}^{\frac{1}{q}}}.
  \]
  Here $F(x) \geq 0$ and $G(x) \geq 0$ are well-defined and Riemann integrable.
  Thus the conclusion holds.
  The equality holds if $F(x)^p = G(x)^q$
  or
  \[
    \frac{|f|^p}{\int_{a}^{b} |f|^p d\alpha}
    =
    \frac{|g|^q}{\int_{a}^{b} |g|^q d\alpha}.
  \]
  Note that the equality does not hold only if
  $\frac{|f|^p}{\int_{a}^{b} |f|^p d\alpha}
  =
  \frac{|g|^q}{\int_{a}^{b} |g|^q d\alpha}$.
  Luckily, it is true for the additional assumption that
  $\alpha(x) = x$ and $f, g$ are continuous on $[a,b]$.
\end{enumerate}
By (1)(2)(3),
in any case the equality holds if
\[
  |f|^p \int_{a}^{b} |g|^q d\alpha = |g|^q \int_{a}^{b} |f|^p d\alpha.
\]
In addition, if $\alpha(x) = x$ and $f, g$ are continuous on $[a,b]$,
then the equality holds if and only if
\[
  |f|^p \int_{a}^{b} |g|^q d\alpha = |g|^q \int_{a}^{b} |f|^p d\alpha.
\]
$\Box$ \\



\emph{Proof of (d).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  \emph{Suppose $f$ and $g$ are real functions on $(0,1]$

      \leq
      \left\{ \int_{c}^{1} |f|^p dx \right\}^{\frac{1}{p}}
      \left\{ \int_{c}^{1} |g|^q dx \right\}^{\frac{1}{q}}
    \]
    for any $c \in (0,1]$.
    Here every integral is well-defined (Theorem 6.11 and Theorem 6.13).

  \item[(b)]
    Since every integral is $\geq 0$, by taking the limit in the right hand side
    we have
    \begin{align*}
      \abs{ \int_{c}^{1} fg dx }
      &\leq
      \left\{ \int_{c}^{1} |f|^p dx \right\}^{\frac{1}{p}}

      &\leq
      \left\{ \int_{0}^{1} |f|^p dx \right\}^{\frac{1}{p}}
      \left\{ \int_{0}^{1} |g|^q dx \right\}^{\frac{1}{q}}.
    \end{align*}
    It is possible that $\left\{ \int_{0}^{1} |f|^p dx \right\}^{\frac{1}{p}} = \infty$
    or $\left\{ \int_{0}^{1} |g|^q dx \right\}^{\frac{1}{q}} = \infty$.

  \item[(c)]
    Now $\abs{ \int_{c}^{1} fg dx }$ is bounded by
    $\left\{ \int_{0}^{1} |f|^p dx \right\}^{\frac{1}{p}}
    \left\{ \int_{0}^{1} |g|^q dx \right\}^{\frac{1}{q}}$.
    Take limit to get
    \[
      \abs{ \int_{0}^{1} fg dx }
      \leq
      \left\{ \int_{0}^{1} |f|^p dx \right\}^{\frac{1}{p}}
      \left\{ \int_{0}^{1} |g|^q dx \right\}^{\frac{1}{q}}
    \]
    even if some limit is divergent.

  \item[(2)]

Prove that there exists a continuous function $g$ on $[a,b]$
such that $\norm{f-g}_2 < \varepsilon$.
(Hint: Let $P = \{a=x_0 \leq \cdots \leq x_n = b\}$ be a suitable partition of $[a,b]$,
define
\[
  g(t) = \frac{x_i-t}{\Delta x_i} f(x_{i-1}) + \frac{t-x_{i-1}}{\Delta x_i} f(x_i)
\]
if $x_{i-1} \leq t \leq x_i$.)} \\

\emph{Proof.}
Given $\varepsilon > 0$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
There are some real numbers $m$ and $M$
such that $m \leq f(x) \leq M$ if $x \in [a,b]$ since $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$
or $f$ is bounded on $[a,b]$.
By Theorem 6.6, there exists a partition
$P = \{a=x_0 \leq \cdots \leq x_n = b\}$ such that
\[
  U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) < \frac{\varepsilon^2}{M - m + 1}.
\]
Here
\begin{align*}
  U(P,f,\alpha) &= \sum_{i=1}^n M_i \Delta \alpha_i
    \text{ where } M_i = \sup_{x_{i-1} \leq x \leq x_i} f(x) \\
  L(P,f,\alpha) &= \sum_{i=1}^n m_i \Delta \alpha_i
    \text{ where } m_i = \inf_{x_{i-1} \leq x \leq x_i} f(x).
\end{align*}

\item[(2)]
For such partition $P$, define $g$ on $[a,b]$ by
\[
  g(t) = \frac{x_i-t}{\Delta x_i} f(x_{i-1}) + \frac{t-x_{i-1}}{\Delta x_i} f(x_i)
\]
if $x_{i-1} \leq t \leq x_i$.
So that
\begin{align*}
  \abs{ f(t) - g(t) }
  &= \abs{ \left( \frac{x_i-t}{\Delta x_i} + \frac{t-x_{i-1}}{\Delta x_i} \right) f(t)
    - \frac{x_i-t}{\Delta x_i} f(x_{i-1}) + \frac{t-x_{i-1}}{\Delta x_i} f(x_i) } \\
  &= \abs{ \frac{x_i-t}{\Delta x_i}(f(t) - f(x_{i-1}))
    +  \frac{t-x_{i-1}}{\Delta x_i}(f(t) - f(x_i)) } \\
  &\leq \frac{x_i-t}{\Delta x_i}\abs{ f(t) - f(x_{i-1}) }
    +  \frac{t-x_{i-1}}{\Delta x_i}\abs{ f(t) - f(x_i) } \\
  &\leq \frac{x_i-t}{\Delta x_i} (M_i - m_i) + \frac{t-x_{i-1}}{\Delta x_i}(M_i - m_i) \\
  &= M_i - m_i
\end{align*}
if $x_{i-1} \leq t \leq x_i$.
Especially,
\[
  \abs{ f(t) - g(t) } \leq M - m
\]
if $a \leq t \leq b$.

\item[(3)]
Note that the integral $\int_{a}^{b} |f-g|^2 d\alpha$ is well-defined
(Theorem 6.8, Theorem 6.11 and Theorem 6.12).
So that
\begin{align*}
  \int_{a}^{b} |f-g|^2 d\alpha
  =& \sum_{i=1}^n \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} |f-g|^2 d\alpha \\
  \leq& \sum_{i=1}^n \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} (M-m)(M_i - m_i) d\alpha \\
  =& (M-m) \sum_{i=1}^n \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} (M_i - m_i) \Delta \alpha_i \\
  =& (M-m) [ U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) ] \\
  \leq& (M-m) \cdot \frac{\varepsilon^2}{M - m + 1} \\
  <& \varepsilon^2.
\end{align*}
Hence,
\[
  \norm{f-g}_2
  = \left\{ \int_{a}^{b} |f-g|^2 d\alpha \right\}^{\frac{1}{2}}
  < \varepsilon.

\]
and that
\[
  \int_{a}^{b} [f'(x)]^2 dx \int_{a}^{b} x^2f(x)^2 dx > \frac{1}{4}.
\]
} \\

\emph{Proof.}
Every integral is well-defined (Theorem 4.9 and Theorem 6.8).
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
  By Theorem 6.22 (integration by parts),
  \[
    \int_{a}^{b} x \left( \frac{f(x)^2}{2} \right)' dx
    =
    \left[ x \cdot \frac{f(x)^2}{2} \right]_{x=a}^{x=b}
      - \int_{a}^{b} \frac{f(x)^2}{2} dx,
  \]
  or
  \[
    \int_{a}^{b} xf(x)f'(x) dx
    =
      \left[b \cdot \frac{f(b)^2}{2} - a \cdot \frac{f(a)^2}{2} \right]
      - \frac{1}{2} \int_{a}^{b} f(x)^2 dx
    = - \frac{1}{2}.
  \]

  \item[(2)]
  By Exercise 6.10(c),
  \[
    \int_{a}^{b} [f'(x)]^2 dx \int_{a}^{b} x^2f(x)^2 dx
    \geq \left( \int_{a}^{b} xf(x)f'(x) dx \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
  \]

  \item[(3)]
  (Reductio ad absurdum)
  If the equality were holding, then by Exercise 6.10(c)
  \[
    (f'(x))^2 \int_{a}^{b} x^2f(x)^2 dx
    = x^2f(x)^2 \int_{a}^{b} [f'(x)]^2 dx
  \]
  on $[a,b]$
  (since $x$, $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ are continuous on $[a,b]$).

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
    \emph{Show that both integrals are nonzero.}
    (Reductio ad absurdum)
    If $\int_{a}^{b} x^2f(x)^2 dx = 0$,
    then $x^2f(x)^2 = 0$ or $xf(x) = 0$ on $[a,b]$ (Exercise 6.2).
    So that
    \[
      \int_{a}^{b} xf(x)f'(x) dx = 0 \neq -\frac{1}{2},
    \]
    which is absure.
    Similarly, $\int_{a}^{b} [f'(x)]^2 dx \neq 0$.

  \item[(b)]
    By (a), we write
    \[
      C
      =
      \left\{ \frac{\int_{a}^{b} [f'(x)]^2 dx}{\int_{a}^{b} x^2f(x)^2 dx} \right\}^{\frac{1}{2}}
      > 0
    \]
    be a positive constant.
    Hence
    \[
      f'(x) = \pm C x f(x).
    \]
    Here the sign ``$\pm$'' is not necessary unchanged on $[a,b]$.
    Luckily, we can show that the sign ``$\pm$'' is unchanged on some subinterval of $[a,b]$.

  \item[(c)]
    To find such subinterval of $[a,b]$,
    we consider the zero set $Z(f')$ and $Z(xf)$ on $[a,b]$.
    Since $f'(x) = \pm C x f(x)$ with $C > 0$, we have
    \[
      Z(f') = Z(xf).
    \]
    Note that $Z(f') = Z(xf)$ is closed (Exercise 4.3) and not equal to $[a,b]$
    (by applying the same argument in (a)).
    Hence the complement of $Z(f') = Z(xf)$ is open and nonempty,
    which can be written as the union of an at most countable collection
    of disjoint segments (Exercise 2.29).

  \item[(d)]
    Consider any nonempty open interval in (c), say
    \[
      (c,d) \subseteq [a,b].
    \]
    By construction, $f'(x) \neq 0$ for all $x \in (c,d)$.
    Since $f'(x)$ is continuous, by Theorem 4.23
    there are only two mutually exclusive possible cases:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[(i)]
      $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \in (c,d)$,

      \item[(ii)]
      $f'(x) < 0$ for all $x \in (c,d)$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Similar result for $xf(x)$.
    Therefore, the sign ``$\pm$'' of $f'(x) = \pm C x f(x)$ are unchanged on $(c,d)$,
    that is,
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[(i)]
      $f'(x) = C x f(x)$ for all $x \in (c,d)$,

      \item[(ii)]
      $f'(x) = -C x f(x)$ for all $x \in (c,d)$,
    \end{enumerate}

  \item[(e)]
    Suppose $f'(x) = C xf(x)$ on $(c,d)$.
    Since $f'(x)$ and $xf(x)$ are both vanishing at $x = c$ and $x = d$,
    $f'(x) = C xf(x)$ at $x = c$ and $x = d$.
    So
    \[
      f'(x) = C xf(x) \:\text{ if }\: x \in [c,d].
    \]
    Define
    \[
      \phi(x,y) = Cxy
    \]
    be a real function on $R = [c,d] \times \mathbb{R}$.
    And consider the initial-value problem
    \[
      y' = \phi(x,y)

      y(c) = 0.
    \]
    Then
    \[
      |\phi(x,y_2) - \phi(x,y_1)|
      = Cx|y_2-y_1|
      \leq A|y_2-y_1|
    \]
    where $A = C \cdot \max\{|c|,|d|\}$ is a constant.
    By Exercise 5.27, this initial-value problem has at most one solution.
    Clearly, $y = f(x) = 0$ on $[c,d]$ is one solution of this initial-value problem,
    contrary to the construction of $[c,d]$.
    Similar result for the case $f'(x) = -C xf(x)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Therefore, the equality does not hold.
