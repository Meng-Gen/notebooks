\textbf{Exercise 10.2.}
\emph{For $i=1,2,3,\ldots$, let $\varphi_i \in \mathscr{C}(\mathbb{R}^1)$ have support
in $(2^{-i},2^{1-i})$, such that $\int \varphi_i = 1$.
Put
\[
  f(x,y) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}[ \varphi_i(x)-\varphi_{i+1}(x) ] \varphi_i(y)
\]
Then $f$ has compact support in $\mathbb{R}^2$,
$f$ is continuous except at $(0,0)$,
and
\[
  \int dy \int f(x,y) dx = 0

\textbf{Exercise 10.4.}
\emph{For $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, define
\[
  \mathbf{F}(x,y) = (e^x \cos y - 1, e^x \sin y)
\]
Prove that $\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{G}_2 \circ \mathbf{G}_1$, where
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{G}_1(x,y) &= (e^x \cos y - 1, y) \\
  \mathbf{G}_2(u,v) &= (u, (1+u) \tan v)

Compute the Jacobians of $\mathbf{G}_1$, $\mathbf{G}_2$, $\mathbf{F}$ at $(0,0)$.
Define
\[
  \mathbf{H}_2(x,y) = (x, e^x \sin y)
\]
and find
\[
  \mathbf{H}_1(u,v) = (h(u,v),v)
\]
so that $\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{H}_1 \circ \mathbf{H}_2$
is in some neighborhood of $(0,0)$.} \\



\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  By Definition 10.5,
  \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{G}_1(x,y) &= (e^x \cos y - 1) \mathbf{e}_1 + y \mathbf{e}_2, \\
    \mathbf{G}_2(u,v) &= u \mathbf{e}_1 + ((1+u) \tan v) \mathbf{e}_2
  \end{align*}
  are primitive in some neighborhood of $(0,0)$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{G}_2 \circ \mathbf{G}_1$.}
  Given any $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    (\mathbf{G}_2 \circ \mathbf{G}_1)(x,y)
    &= \mathbf{G}_2(\mathbf{G}_1(x,y)) \\
    &= \mathbf{G}_2(e^x \cos y - 1, y) \\
    &= (e^x \cos y - 1, (1+(e^x \cos y - 1)) \tan y) \\
    &= (e^x \cos y - 1, e^x \sin y) \\
    &= \mathbf{F}(x,y).
  \end{align*}

\item[(3)]
  Since
  \begin{align*}
    J_{\mathbf{G}_1}(x,y)
    &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      e^x \cos y & -e^x \sin y \\
      0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix} \\
    J_{\mathbf{G}_2}(x,y)
    &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      \tan y & (1+x)\sec^2 y
    \end{bmatrix} \\
    J_{\mathbf{F}}(x,y)
    &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      e^x \cos y & -e^x \sin y \\
      e^x \sin y & e^x \cos y
    \end{bmatrix},
  \end{align*}
  \begin{align*}
    J_{\mathbf{G}_1}(0,0)
    &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix} \\
     J_{\mathbf{G}_2}(0,0)
    &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix} \\
     J_{\mathbf{F}}(0,0)
    &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}.
  \end{align*}

\item[(4)]
  Define $h(u,v) = \sqrt{e^{2u} - v^{2}} - 1$ on
  \[
    B\left((0,0);\frac{1}{64}\right) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2.
  \]
  $h(u,v)$ is well-defined since $e^{2u}-v^2 > 0$
  for all $(u,v) \in B\left((0,0);\frac{1}{64}\right)$.

\item[(5)]
  Given any $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    (\mathbf{H}_1 \circ \mathbf{H}_2)(x,y)
    &= \mathbf{H}_1(\mathbf{H}_2(x,y)) \\
    &= \mathbf{H}_1(x, e^x \sin y) \\
    &= (\sqrt{e^{2x} - (e^x \sin y)^2} - 1, e^x \sin y) \\
    &= (e^x \cos y - 1, e^x \sin y) \\
    &= \mathbf{F}(x,y).

\textbf{Exercise 10.8.}
\emph{Let $H$ be the parallelogram in $\mathbb{R}^2$ whose vertices are
$(1,1)$, $(3,2)$, $(4,5)$, $(2,4)$.
Find the affine map $T$ which sends
$(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$, $(1,0)$ to $(3,2)$, $(1,1)$ to $(4,5)$, $(0,1)$ to $(2,4)$.
Show that $J_{T} = 5$.
Use $T$ to convert the integral
\[
  \alpha = \int_{H} e^{x-y} dxdy
\]
to an integral over $I^2$ and thus compute $\alpha$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  By Affine simplexes 10.26,
  \[
    T(\mathbf{x}) = T(\mathbf{0}) + A\mathbf{x},
  \]
  where $A \in L(\mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{R}^2)$, say
  $A = \begin{bmatrix}
    a & b \\
    c & d
  \end{bmatrix}$.
  Note that $T:
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 \\
    0
  \end{bmatrix} \mapsto
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    1
  \end{bmatrix}$.
  Thus
  \[
    T:
    \begin{bmatrix}
      x \\
      y
    \end{bmatrix} \mapsto
    \begin{bmatrix}
      1 \\
      1
    \end{bmatrix}
    +
    \begin{bmatrix}
      a & b \\
      c & d
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      x \\
      y
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      1+ax+by \\
      1+cx+dy
    \end{bmatrix}.
  \]

\item[(2)]
  By $T: (1,0) \mapsto (3,2)$ and $T: (0,1) \mapsto (2,4)$,
  we can solve $A$ as
  \[
    A = \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 1 \\
      1 & 3
    \end{bmatrix}.
  \]
  It is easy to verify such
  \[
    T:
    \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
      x \\
      y
    \end{bmatrix}}_{\mathbf{x}}
    \mapsto
    \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
      1 \\
      1
    \end{bmatrix}}_{T(\mathbf{0})}
    +
    \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 1 \\
      1 & 3
    \end{bmatrix}}_{A}
    \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
      x \\
      y
    \end{bmatrix}}_{\mathbf{x}}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      1+2x+y \\
      1+x+3y
    \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  satisfying our requirement.

\item[(3)]
  \[
    J_T
    =
    \det\begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 1 \\
      1 & 3
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 5.
  \]

\item[(4)]
  We cannot apply Theorem 10.9 directly as Exercise 10.9.
  Luckily, we might use the first part of the proof in Theorem 10.9 to
  show that
  \[
    \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} f(\mathbf{y}) d\mathbf{y}
    = \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} f(T(\mathbf{x})) \abs{J_T(\mathbf{x})} d\mathbf{x}
  \]
  holds for affine maps by Theorem 10.2 again.
  Hence
  \begin{align*}
    \int_{H} e^{x-y} dxdy
    &= \int_{[0,1]^2} e^{(1+2u+v)-(1+u+3v)} \abs{J_T} du dv \\
    &= 5 \int_{[0,1]^2} e^{u-2v} du dv \\
    &= 5 \left\{ \int_{0}^{1} e^u du \right\}\left\{ \int_{0}^{1} e^{-2v} dv \right\}
      &(\text{Theorem 10.2}) \\
    &= \frac{5}{2}(e-1)(1-e^{-2}).
  \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\\\
