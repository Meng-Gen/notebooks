\emph{If $\omega$ and $\lambda$ are $k$- and $m$-forms, respectively, 
prove that}
\[
  \omega \wedge \lambda = (-1)^{km} \lambda \wedge \omega.
\]

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
  Write
  \[
    \omega = \sum_I b_I(\mathbf{x}) dx_I,
    \qquad
    \lambda = \sum_J c_J(\mathbf{x}) dx_J
  \]
  in the stardard presentations,
  where $I$ and $J$ range over all increasing $k$-indices
  and over all increasing $m$-indices taken from the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$.

\item[(2)]
  \emph{Show that $dx_I \wedge dx_J = (-1)^{km} dx_J \wedge dx_I$.}
  \begin{align*}
    dx_I \wedge dx_J
    &= dx_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{i_k}
      \wedge dx_J \\
    &= (-1)^m dx_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{i_{k-1}}
      \wedge dx_J \wedge dx_{i_{k}} \\
    &= (-1)^{2m} dx_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{i_{k-2}}
      \wedge dx_J \wedge dx_{i_{k-1}} \wedge dx_{i_{k}} \\
    &\cdots \\
    &= (-1)^{km} dx_J
      \wedge dx_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{i_k} \\
    &= (-1)^{km} dx_J \wedge dx_I.
  \end{align*}

\item[(3)]
  \begin{align*}
    \omega \wedge \lambda
    &= \sum_{I,J} b_I(\mathbf{x}) c_J(\mathbf{x}) dx_I \wedge dx_J \\
    &= (-1)^{km} \sum_{J,I} c_J(\mathbf{x}) b_I(\mathbf{x}) dx_J \wedge dx_I \\
    &= (-1)^{km} \lambda \wedge \omega.
