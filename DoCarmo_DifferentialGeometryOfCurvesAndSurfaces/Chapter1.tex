\textbf{\large Section 1-2: Parametrized Curves} \\

\textbf{Exercise 1-2.1.}
\emph{Find a parametrized curve $\alpha(t)$ whose trace is the circle
$x^2 + y^2 = 1$ such that $\alpha(t)$ runs clockwise around the circle
with $\alpha(0) = (0,1)$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
$\alpha(t) = (\sin t, \cos t)$, $t \in \mathbb{R}$.
$\Box$ \\\\



\textbf{Exercise 1-2.2.}
\emph{Let $\alpha(t)$ be a parametrized curve which does not pass through the origin.
If $\alpha(t_0)$ is the point of the trace of $\alpha$ closest to the origin
and $\alpha'(t_0) \neq 0$, show that the position vector $\alpha(t_0)$ is
orthogonal to $\alpha'(t_0)$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
Let $f(t) = |\alpha(t)|^2 = \alpha(t) \cdot \alpha(t)$.
$f(t)$ is differentiable and $f(t)$ has a local minimum at a point $t = t_0 \in I$.
So $f'(t_0) = 0$. [Theorem 5.8 in W. Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis, 3rd edition.]
Since
$$f'(t) = 2 \alpha(t) \cdot \alpha'(t),$$
$f'(t_0) = 2 \alpha(t_0) \cdot \alpha'(t_0) = 0$,
or $\alpha(t_0) \cdot \alpha'(t_0) = 0$.
Since $\alpha(t_0) \neq 0$ and $\alpha'(t_0) \neq 0$,
$\alpha(t_0)$ is orthogonal to $\alpha'(t_0)$.
$\Box$ \\\\



\textbf{Exercise 1-2.3.}
\emph{A parametrized curve $\alpha(t)$ has a property that its second derivative
$\alpha''(t)$ is identically zero.
What can be said about $\alpha$?} \\

$\alpha(t)$ is a straight line. \\

\emph{Proof.}
Since $\alpha''(t)$ is identically zero,
$\alpha'(t) = a$ is a constant.
[Theorem 5.11 in W. Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis, 3rd edition.]
Define $f(t) = \alpha(t) - at$ (on $I$).
Since $f'(t) = \alpha'(t) - a = 0$,
$f(t) = \alpha(t) - at = b$ is a constant again.
Therefore, $\alpha(t) = at+b$, which is a straight line (on $I$).
$\Box$ \\\\



\textbf{Exercise 1-2.4.}
\emph{Let $\alpha: I \to \mathbb{R}^3$ be a parametrized curve and
let $v \in \mathbb{R}^3$ be a fixed vector.
Assume that $\alpha'(t)$ is orthogonal to $v$ for all $t \in I$
and that $\alpha(0)$ is orthogonal to $v$.
Prove that $\alpha(t)$ is orthogonal to $v$ for all $t \in I$.} \\

Need to assume that $\alpha(t) \neq 0$ for all $t \in I$. \\

\emph{Proof.}
Given any $t \neq 0 \in I$. (Nothing to do at $t = 0$.)
Define $f: I \to \mathbb{R}$ by $f(t) = \alpha(t) \cdot v$.
By the mean value theorem, there exists a point $\xi$ between $0$ and $t$
such that
$$f(t) - f(0) = f'(\xi)(t - 0),$$
where $f'(t) = \alpha'(t) \cdot v + \alpha(t) \cdot v' = \alpha'(t) \cdot v$.
Note that $f(0) = 0$ since $\alpha(0)$ is orthogonal to $v$,
and $f'(\xi) = 0$ since $\alpha'(t)$ is orthogonal to $v$.
So the identity is reduced to
$$f(t) = 0,$$
or $\alpha(t) \cdot v = 0$,
or $\alpha(t)$ is orthogonal to $v$.
$\Box$ \\\\



\textbf{Exercise 1-2.5.}
\emph{Let $\alpha: I \to \mathbb{R}^3$ be a parametrized curve,
with $\alpha'(t) \neq 0$ for all $t \in I$.
Show that $|\alpha(t)|$ is a nonzero constant
if and only if
$\alpha(t)$ is orthogonal to $\alpha'(t)$ for all $t \in I$.} \\

The same trick in Exercise 1-2.2. \\

\emph{Proof.}
It is equivalent to
\emph{show that $|\alpha(t)|^2$ is a nonzero constant
if and only if
$\alpha(t)$ is orthogonal to $\alpha'(t)$ for all $t \in I$.}
Let $$f(t) = |\alpha(t)|^2 = \alpha(t) \cdot \alpha(t).$$
Notice that $\alpha'(t) \neq 0$, and thus
\begin{align*}
&|\alpha(t)| \text{ is a nonzero constant} \\
\Longleftrightarrow&
f(t) = |\alpha(t)|^2 \text{ is a nonzero constant} \\
\Longleftrightarrow&
f'(t) = 0 \text{ and } f(t) \text{ is a nonzero constant} \\
\Longleftrightarrow&
\alpha(t) \cdot \alpha'(t) = 0 \text{ and } \alpha(t) \text{ is a nonzero constant} \\
\Longleftrightarrow&
\alpha(t) \text{ is orthogonal to } \alpha'(t) \text{ for all } t \in I.
\end{align*}
$\Box$ \\\\

\textbf{\large Section 1-3: Regular Curves; Arc Length} \\



\textbf{Exercise 1-3.1.}
\emph{Show that the tangent lines to the regular parametrized curve
$\alpha(t) = (3t, 3t^2, 2t^3)$ make a constant angle with the line $y = 0$, $z = x$. } \\

\emph{Proof.}
$\alpha'(t) = (3, 6t, 6t^2)$.
The line $y = 0$, $z = x$ is $\beta(t) = (1,0,1)$.
The cosine of the angle $\theta$ between these to curves is
\begin{align*}
\cos \theta
&= \frac{(3, 6t, 6t^2) \cdot (1,0,1)}{|(3, 6t, 6t^2)||(1,0,1)|} \\
&= \frac{3+6t^2}{\sqrt{3^2 + (6t)^2 + (6t^2)^2}\sqrt{2}} \\
&= \frac{3+6t^2}{\sqrt{9 + 36 t^2 + 36t^4}\sqrt{2}} \\
&= \frac{3+6t^2}{\sqrt{(3 + 6t^2)^2}\sqrt{2}} \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{align*}
(Notice $3 + 6t^2 > 0$ for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$.)
That is, the angle between $\alpha'$ and $\beta$ is a constant ($= \pi/4$).
$\Box$ \\\\

\textbf{Exercise 1-3.2.}
\emph{A circular disk of radius $1$ in the plane $xy$ rolls without slipping
along the $x$ axis.
The figure described by a point of the circumference of of the disk is
called a \textbf{cycloid}
(Figure 1-7 in Mantredo P. do Carmo, Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces).}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  \emph{Obtain a parametrized curve $\alpha: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^2$
  the trace of which is the cycloid and determine its singular points.}
  \item[(b)]
  \emph{Compute the arc length of the cycloid
  corresponding to a complete rotation of the disk.} \\
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
Since
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
     x = t - \sin t \\
     y = 1 - \cos t,
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
we define $\alpha(t) = (t - \sin t, 1 - \cos t)$.
\item[(2)]
$\alpha'(t) = (1 - \cos t, \sin t)$.
$\alpha'(t) = 0$ if and only if $t = 2n\pi$ where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
That is, all singular points are $\alpha(2n\pi) = (2n\pi, 0)$ where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Proof of (b).}
The arc length of the cycloid corresponding to a complete rotation of the disk is
\begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{2\pi} |\alpha'(t)| dt
&= \int_{0}^{2\pi} \sqrt{(1-\cos t)^2 + (\sin t)^2} dt \\
&= \int_{0}^{2\pi} \sqrt{2} \sqrt{1 - \cos t} dt \\
&= \int_{0}^{2\pi} 2 \sin \frac{t}{2} dt \\
&= \left[ -4 \cos\frac{t}{2} \right]_{t=0}^{t=2\pi} \\
&= 8.
\end{align*}
$\Box$ \\

\textbf{Supplement.}
The cycloid is not an algebraic curve. \\\\

\textbf{Exercise 1-3.4.}
\emph{Let $\alpha: (0, \pi) \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be given by
$$\alpha(t) = \left(\sin t, \cos t + \log\tan\frac{t}{2}\right),$$
where $t$ is the angle that the $y$ axis makes with the vector $\alpha(t)$.
The trace of $\alpha$ is called the \textbf{tractrix}.
(Figure 1-9 in Mantredo P. do Carmo, Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces).
Show that}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  \emph{$\alpha$ is a differentiable parametrized curve,
  regular except at $t = \frac{\pi}{2}$.}
  \item[(b)]
  \emph{The length of the segment of the tangent of the tractrix between
  the point of tangency and the $y$ axis is constantly equal to $1$.} \\
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Proof of (a).}
\begin{align*}
\alpha'(t)
&= \left(
\cos t,
-\sin t + \frac{1}{\tan\frac{t}{2}} \frac{1}{\cos^{2}\frac{t}{2}} \frac{1}{2}
\right) \\
&= \left(
\cos t,
-\sin t + \frac{1}{2 \sin\frac{t}{2} \cos\frac{t}{2}}
\right) \\
&= \left(
\cos t,
\frac{\cos^2 t}{\sin t}
\right)
\end{align*}
exists.
And $\alpha'(t) = 0$ if and only if $t = \frac{\pi}{2}$.
That is, there is an unique singular point at $t = \frac{\pi}{2}$.
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Proof of (b).}
The the tangent line of the tractrix through the regular point $t$
is parametrized by $\beta: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^2$ which is defined by
\begin{align*}
\beta(u)
&= u\alpha'(t) + \alpha(t) \\
&= \left( u \cos t + \sin t, u \frac{\cos^2 t}{\sin t} + \cos t + \log\tan\frac{t}{2} \right).
\end{align*}
By construction, this tangent line $\beta(u)$ meets the tractrix at $u = 0$,
and meets the $y$-axis when $u \cos t + \sin t = 0$ or $u = -\tan t$.
So the length of the segment is
\begin{align*}
|\beta(0) - \beta(-\tan t)|
&= \sqrt{(-\tan t \cos t)^2+ \left( -\tan t \frac{\cos^2 t}{\sin t} \right)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{(\sin t)^2+ (\cos t)^2} \\
&= 1.
\end{align*}
$\Box$ \\\\

\textbf{Exercise 1-3.10.}
\emph{(Straight Lines as Shortest.)
Let $\alpha: I \to \mathbb{R}^3$ be a parametrized curve.
Let $[a,b] \subseteq I$ and set $\alpha(a) = p$, $\alpha(b) = q$.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  \emph{Show that, for any constant vector $v$, $|v| = 1$,
  $$(q-p) \cdot v
  = \int_{a}^{b} \alpha'(t) \cdot v dt
  \leq \int_{a}^{b} |\alpha'(t)| dt.$$}
  \item[(b)]
  \emph{Set
  $$v = \frac{q-p}{|q-p|}$$
  and show that
  $$|\alpha(b) - \alpha(a)| \leq \int_{a}^{b} |\alpha'(t)| dt;$$
  that is, the curve of shortest length from
  $\alpha(a)$ to $\alpha(b)$ is the straight line
  joining these points.} \\
\end{enumerate}

Assume $p \neq q$ (otherwise $v = \frac{q-p}{|q-p|}$ is meaningless). \\

\emph{Proof of (a).}
Let $f(t) = \alpha(t) \cdot v$ defined on $I$.
By the fundamental theorem of calculus,
$$\int_{a}^{b} f'(t) dt = f(b) - f(a).$$
Since $f'(t) = \alpha'(t) \cdot v$,
$$(\alpha(b) - \alpha(a)) \cdot v = \int_{a}^{b} \alpha'(t) \cdot v dt.$$
Therefore,
\begin{align*}
(q - p) \cdot v
&= \int_{a}^{b} \alpha'(t) \cdot v dt \\
&\leq \int_{a}^{b} |\alpha'(t) \cdot v| dt \\
&\leq \int_{a}^{b} |\alpha'(t)||v| dt \\
&= \int_{a}^{b} |\alpha'(t)| dt.
\end{align*}
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Proof of (b).}
$|v| = \frac{|q-p|}{|q-p|} = 1$.
So,
\begin{align*}
(q-p) \cdot \frac{q-p}{|q-p|}
&\leq \int_{a}^{b} |\alpha'(t)| dt, \\
|q-p|
&\leq \int_{a}^{b} |\alpha'(t)| dt.
\end{align*}
$\Box$ \\\\

\textbf{\large Section 1-4: The Vector Product in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$} \\



\textbf{Exercise 1-4.1.}
\emph{Check whether the following bases are positive:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  \emph{The basis $\{(1,3), (4,2)\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$.}
  \item[(b)]
  \emph{The basis $\{(1,3,5), (2,3,7), (4,8,3)\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$.} \\
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Proof of (a).}
Write $u = (1,3)$ and $v = (4,2)$.
Then
$$\det(u,v)
= \begin{vmatrix}
  1 & 3 \\
  4 & 2
  \end{vmatrix}
= -10 < 0.$$
Thus $\{u,v\}$ is negative w.r.t. the natural order basis $\{ e_1 = (1,0), e_2 = (0,1) \}$.
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Proof of (b).}
Write $u = (1,3,5)$, $v = (2,3,7)$, $w = (4,8,3)$.
Then
$$\det(u,v,w)
= \begin{vmatrix}
  1 & 3 & 5 \\
  2 & 3 & 7 \\
  4 & 8 & 3
  \end{vmatrix}
= 39 > 0.$$
Thus $\{u,v,w\}$ is positive w.r.t. the natural order basis $\{ e_1, e_2, e_3 \}$.
$\Box$ \\\\

\textbf{Exercise 1-4.2.}
\emph{A plane $P$ contained in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is given by the equation
$ax+by+cz+d=0$.
Show that the vector $v=(a,b,c)$ is perpendicular to the plane and that
$|d|/\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}$ measures the distance from the plane to the origin $(0,0,0)$.} \\

Say $v$ is a normal vector of $E$. \\

In general, the distance from the plane $E$ to
any point $(x_0, y_0, z_0) \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is
$$\frac{|ax_0+by_0+cz_0+d|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}.$$

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
To show $v=(a,b,c)$ is perpendicular to the plane,
it suffices to show that $v \cdot u = 0$ for any vector $u$ lying on the plane $E$.
Write $u = \overrightarrow{PQ}$ where
$P = (x_1, y_1, z_1) \in E$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2, z_2) \in E$.
Hence $u = (x_2-x_1, y_2-y_1, z_2-z_1)$.
\begin{align*}
v \cdot u
&=
(a,b,c) \cdot (x_2-x_1, y_2-y_1, z_2-z_1) \\
&= a(x_2-x_1) + b(y_2-y_1) + c(z_2-z_1) \\
&= (ax_2 + by_2 + cz_2) - (ax_1 + by_1 + cz_1) \\
&= (-d) - (-d) \\
&= 0.
\end{align*}
\item[(2)]
Pick any point $(x_1,y_1,z_1) \in E$.
The distance from the plane $E$ to the point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is
\begin{align*}
&\abs{(x_1-x_0,y_1-y_0,z_1-z_0) \cdot \frac{v}{|v|}} \\
=& \abs{(x_1-x_0,y_1-y_0,z_1-z_0) \cdot \frac{(a,b,c)}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}} \\
=& \frac{\abs{a(x_1-x_0)+b(y_1-y_0)+c(z_1-z_0)}}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}} \\
=& \frac{\abs{(ax_1+by_1+cz_1) - (ax_0+by_0+cz_0)}}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}} \\
=& \frac{\abs{-d - (ax_0+by_0+cz_0)}}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}} \\
=& \frac{\abs{ax_0+by_0+cz_0+d}}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}.

\textbf{Exercise 1-4.3.}
\emph{Determine the angle of intersection of the two planes
$5x+3y+2z-4=0$ and $3x+4y-7z=0$.} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
The angle of intersection of the two planes
is equal to a angle between two normal vectors of planes.
\item[(2)]
Let
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)]
  the angle of intersection of the two planes be $\theta$.
  \item[(b)]
  the normal vector of $5x+3y+2z-4=0$ be $n_1 = (5,3,2)$.
  \item[(c)]
  the normal vector of $3x+4y-7z=0$ be $n_2 = (3,4,-7)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\item[(3)]
Hence,
$$\cos\theta = \frac{n_1 \cdot n_2}{|n_1||n_2|} = \frac{13}{2\sqrt{703}}.$$
$\theta = \cos^{-1}\left( \frac{13}{2\sqrt{703}} \right)$.

$$\tau(s) = -\frac{\alpha'(s) \wedge \alpha''(s) \cdot \alpha'''(s)}{|\kappa(s)|^2}.$$} \\

\emph{Proof.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
Take inner product $n(s)$
to the definition of torsion $\tau(s) n(s) = b'(s)$,
we have $$\tau(s) = b'(s) \cdot n(s).$$
Since $b'(s) = t(s) \wedge n'(s)$, we have to compute $n'(s)$ first.

Compute $n'(s)$.
$$n'(s)

\item[(3)]
By (1)(2),
\begin{align*}
\tau(s)
