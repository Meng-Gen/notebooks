\textbf{Exercise 2.15.}
\emph{A real number is called algebraic
if it is a root of an algebraic equation $f(x) = 0$,
where $a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n = 0$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients.
Prove that the set of all polynomials with integer coefficients is countable
and deduce that the set of algebraic numbers is also countable.} \\

Might assume $a_n \neq 0$. \\

For example, all rational numbers are algebraic
since $p = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}$ (where $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}$)
is a root of $\beta x - \alpha = 0$. \\

Besides, $x = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}$ is algebraic since $x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 = 0$.
In fact, $x = \pm\sqrt{2} + \pm\sqrt{3}$ are also algebraic since
$x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 =
(x - \sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3})(x + \sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3})
(x - \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})(x + \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})$. \\

\textbf{Note.} Tom M. Apostol's definition of \emph{countable} set is different from
Walter Rudin's one. \\

\textbf{Lemma.}
\emph{The set of all polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}$ is countable implies that
the set of algebraic numbers is countable.} \\

\emph{Proof of Lemma.}
By definition, we write the set of algebraic numbers as
$$S = \bigcup_{f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]} \{ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} : f(\alpha) = 0 \}.$$
Since each polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ roots,
$\{ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} : f(\alpha) = 0 \}$ is finite (or countable)
for each given $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$.
So $S$ is a countable union (by assumption) of countable sets, and hence countable
by Theorem 2.27.
$\Box$ \\

Now we show that
\emph{the set of all polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}$ is countable.} \\

\emph{Proof (Walter Rudin).}
For every positive integer $N$ there are only finitely many equations with
$n + |a_0| + |a_1| + \cdots + |a_n| = N.$
Write
$$P_N = \{ f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x] : n + |a_0| + |a_1| + \cdots + |a_n| = N \}$$
where $f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n$ with $a_n \neq 0$,
and
$$P = \bigcup_{N = 1}^{\infty} P_N.$$
$P$ is the set of all polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}$. \\

Each $P_N$ is finite (or countable) for given $N$
(since the equation $n + |a_0| + |a_1| + \cdots + |a_n| = N$
has finitely many solutions
$(n, a_0, a_1, ..., a_n) \in \mathbb{Z}^{n+2}$).
So $P$ is a countable union of countable sets, and hence countable
by Theorem 2.27.
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Proof (Theorem 2.18).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
\emph{$\mathbb{Z}^N$ is countable for any integer $N > 0$.}
Induction on $N$ and apply the same argument of Theorem 2.18.
\item[(2)]
\emph{The set of all polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}$ is countable.}
Let
$$P_n = \{ f \in \mathbb{Z}[x] : \deg f = n \},$$
and
$$P = \bigcup_{n = 1}^{\infty} P_n = \mathbb{Z}[x].$$

\emph{Claim: $P_n$ is countable.}
Define a one-to-one map $\varphi_n: P_n \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^{n+1}$ by
$$\varphi_n(a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n)
= (a_0, a_1, ..., a_n).$$
By (1) and Theorem 2.16, $P_n$ is countable.
Now $P$ is a countable union of countable sets,
and hence countable by Theorem 2.27.
\end{enumerate}
$\Box$ \\

\emph{Proof (Unique factorization theorem).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
\emph{The set of prime numbers is countable.}
Write all primes in the ascending order as $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n, ...$
where $p_1 = 2, p_2 = 3, ..., p_{10001} = 104743, ...$
(See \href{https://projecteuler.net/problem=7}{ProjectEuler 7: 10001st prime}.
Use sieve of Eratosthenes to get $p_{10001}$.)
\item[(2)]
\emph{The set of all polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}$ is countable.}
Let
$$P_n = \{ f \in \mathbb{Z}[x] : \deg f = n \},$$
and
$$P = \bigcup_{n = 1}^{\infty} P_n = \mathbb{Z}[x].$$

\emph{Claim: $P_n$ is countable.}
Define a map $\varphi_n: P_n \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^+$ by
$$\varphi_n(a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n)
= p_1^{\psi(a_0)} p_2^{\psi(a_1)} \cdots p_{n+1}^{\psi(a_n)},$$
where $\psi$ is a one-to-one correspondence from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}^+$.
By the unique factorization theorem, $\varphi_n$ is one-to-one.
So $P_n$ is countable by Theorem 2.16.
Now $P$ is a countable union of countable sets,
and hence countable by Theorem 2.27.
